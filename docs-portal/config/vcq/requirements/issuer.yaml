    requirement: "Register as an Attestation Provider with the competent authority"
    explanation: |
      Any entity issuing electronic attestations of attributes must register 
      with a Member State authority. Registration establishes eligibility to 
      issue attestations and enables inclusion in Trusted Lists.

      regulation: "2014/910"
      article: "Article 45d"
      paragraph: "1"
    legalText: |
      Electronic attestation of attributes issued by or on behalf of a public 
      sector body responsible for an authentic source shall be issued in 
      accordance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.

    explanation: |
      Attestation Providers must publish machine-readable information about 
      their services, including supported attestation types, data sources,
