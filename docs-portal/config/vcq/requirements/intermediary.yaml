# VCQ Requirements: RP Intermediary (VEND-INT-*)
# 
# These requirements apply to Relying Party Intermediaries as defined in
# Article 5b(10) and ARF Topic 52. An RP Intermediary acts on behalf of
# Relying Parties to interact with EUDI Wallets, performing both:
# - Presentation forwarding (receiving and relaying wallet presentations)
# - Verification operations (signature validation, revocation checking)
#
# NOTE: Per DEC-254, the previous PIF/VIF distinction has been retired.
# The ARF (RPI_09) treats verification as part of the unified RP Intermediary role.
#
# Schema Version: 1
# Created: 2026-01-26
# Decision: DEC-254 (Consolidated from DEC-222 PIF/VIF split)

    requirement: "Display both intermediary and RP identity before requesting attestations"
    explanation: |
      When the intermediary requests attestations from a wallet user, the wallet 
      must display both the intermediary's identity (as the direct requester) and 
      the identity of the ultimate Relying Party on whose behalf the intermediary 
      is acting. This ensures informed consent.

      When an intermediary requests attestations from a wallet unit, the wallet 
      unit shall display both the identity of the intermediary and the identity 
      of the relying party on whose behalf the intermediary is acting.

    explanation: |
      After receiving attestation data from a wallet and verifying it, the 
      intermediary must forward the attributes ONLY to the specific RP on whose 
      behalf the request was made. If verification fails, no attributes may be 
      forwarded.

      PID Provider trust anchors (public keys/certificates). These lists are 
      published by Member States and the Commission and must be refreshed 
      regularly to capture additions, modifications, and revocations.

      EU and Member State Trusted Lists, not from third-party aggregators or 
      unofficial sources. This ensures the authenticity of verification keys.

      The intermediary must verify the cryptographic signatures on attestations 
      and PIDs using the public keys from official Trusted Lists. Invalid or 
      untrusted signatures must result in rejection.

      status lists, OCSP responses, or other revocation mechanisms as specified 
      by the issuer.

      outcome is authentic and unmodified.

      The intermediary should maintain logs of verification operations including 
      verification timestamps, outcomes, and any errors. These logs support 
      dispute resolution and compliance auditing while respecting privacy 
      (no attestation content should be logged).

      Beyond the no-storage mandate, intermediaries must not extract, log, or 
      analyze individual attribute values from wallet presentations. The 
      presentation should be treated as an opaque payload for forwarding.

      across different RP interactions. Each RP relationship must be treated 
      independently to preserve user unlinkability.

      attributes immediately after sending them to the intermediated RP. If 
      forwarding fails or is not performed (e.g., due to verification failure), 
      deletion must still occur immediately after completing all necessary

      Depending on the assurance level required by the RP, the intermediary may 
      need to demonstrate that its cryptographic implementations meet recognized 
      standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2/3, Common Criteria). This is especially relevant 
      for high-assurance use cases.
