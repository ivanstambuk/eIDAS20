    requirement: Intermediaries shall not store data about the content of transactions
    explanation: |
      The no-storage mandate is the central privacy protection for wallet users 
      when interacting through intermediaries. Vendors acting on behalf of RPs 
      are deemed to be relying parties themselves and must not retain any data 
      from wallet presentations beyond what is strictly necessary for immediate 
      transaction completion.

      paragraph: "10"

      Intermediaries acting on behalf of relying parties shall be deemed to be

    requirement: Implement a Data Processing Agreement meeting GDPR Article 28 requirements
    explanation: |
      When intermediaries process personal data on behalf of the RP, they act as 
      data processors. A written contract (DPA) must exist specifying processing 
      instructions, confidentiality, security measures, sub-processor conditions, 
      data subject request assistance, and audit rights.

      processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal 
      data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the
