    requirement: "Intermediaries shall not store data about the content of transactions"
    explanation: |
      The no-storage mandate is the central privacy protection for wallet users 
      when interacting through intermediaries. Vendors acting on behalf of RPs 
      are deemed to be relying parties themselves and must not retain any data 
      from wallet presentations beyond what is strictly necessary for immediate 
      transaction completion.
    legalBasis:
      regulation: "2014/910"
      article: "Article 5b"
      paragraph: "10"
    legalText: |
      Intermediaries acting on behalf of relying parties shall be deemed to be 
      relying parties and shall not store data about the content of the transaction.

    requirement: "Implement a Data Processing Agreement meeting GDPR Article 28 requirements"
    explanation: |
      When intermediaries process personal data on behalf of the RP, they act as 
      data processors. A written contract (DPA) must exist specifying processing 
      instructions, confidentiality, security measures, sub-processor conditions, 
      data subject request assistance, and audit rights.
    legalBasis:
      regulation: "2016/679"
      article: "Article 28"
      paragraph: "3"
    legalText: |
      Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act 
      under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard 
      to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the 
      processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal 
      data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the 
      controller.

    explanation: |
      The RP must be able to verify the vendor's compliance with processing 
      instructions and security requirements. This includes rights to conduct 
      audits and inspections, or to mandate that an independent auditor 
      performs such verification.
