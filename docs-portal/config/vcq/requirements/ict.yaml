    requirement: "Notify the financial entity of ICT-related incidents"
    explanation: |
      The intermediary must notify the financial entity without undue delay 
      of any ICT-related incidents that may impact the service, enabling 
      the financial entity to fulfill its own incident reporting obligations.
    # DEC-261 Rationale: DORA and GDPR independently require incident notification.
    # When an ICT incident involves personal data breach:
    #   - DORA 30(2)(f): ICT incident assistance/notification to financial entity
    #   - GDPR 33(2): Processor must notify controller of personal data breach
    # Both obligations arise independently and must be satisfied.

    category: contracts
    requirement: "Obtain approval for subcontracting of critical functions"
    explanation: |
      If the intermediary subcontracts any part of the ICT service that 
      supports critical or important functions, prior approval from the 
      financial entity is required. The subcontractor must meet equivalent 
      requirements.
    # DEC-261 Rationale: DORA and GDPR independently require subcontracting controls.
    # When a subcontractor also processes personal data:
    #   - DORA 30(2)(d): Prior approval for ICT subcontracting of critical functions
    #   - GDPR 28(2): Prior authorization for engaging sub-processors
    # Both obligations arise independently when subcontractor handles personal data.

      or general written authorisation of the controller.

    requirement: "Comply with enhanced oversight if designated as Critical ICT TPP"

      direct supervision by the Lead Overseer, regular assessments, and 
      additional reporting requirements.

    notes: |
      This requirement is conditional - it only applies if the ESAs designate 
      the vendor as Critical based on systemic importance criteria (Art. 31(2)).
      Most intermediaries will NOT be designated as Critical ICT TPPs.
