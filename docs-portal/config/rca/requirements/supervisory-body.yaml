#   - Article 46b (Supervision of trust services) — replaces original Article 17
#   - Article 46c (Single points of contact)
#   - Article 46d (Mutual assistance)
#   - Article 46e (Cooperation Group)
#
# Note: Member States may designate separate bodies for wallet and trust service
# supervision, or use the same body for both. Profile differentiation reflects this.
