    requirement: Intermediaries acting on behalf of RPs must not store transaction content data
    explanation: |
      When an intermediary (e.g., a payment processor, integration platform) acts on behalf 
      of a relying party, they are deemed to be relying parties themselves and are prohibited 
      from storing data about the content of the transaction. This is the core "no-storage" 
      mandate that distinguishes intermediaries from standard relying parties.

      paragraph: "10"
    legalText: |

      Selective disclosure is a concept empowering the owner of data to disclose 
      only certain parts of a larger data set, in order for the receiving entity 
      to obtain only such information as is necessary for the provision of a 
      service requested by a user. The European Digital Identity Wallet should
