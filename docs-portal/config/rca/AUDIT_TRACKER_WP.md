### Priority Focus Areas

Based on RP audit experience, these are the highest-priority sources for Wallet Provider:

1. **Article 5a** - Core wallet provider duties
2. **Article 6a** - Wallet provision requirements  
3. **Article 5c, 5d, 5e** - Certification and breach response
4. **2024/2979** - Integrity and Core Functionalities (most articles apply)
5. **2024/2981** - Certification implementing act
6. **2024/2982** - Protocols and Interfaces
7. **Recitals 9-26** - Wallet-specific policy context

### Estimated Scope

Based on RP audit patterns, expect:
- **60-100+ requirements** (more than RP due to broader scope)
- **Heavy concentration** in 2024/2979 and 2024/2981
- **Cross-references** to technical standards (ISO, W3C)
