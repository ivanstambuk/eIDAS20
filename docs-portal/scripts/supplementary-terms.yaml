  - term: electronic signature
    definition: >-
      An electronic signature is a data in electronic form which is attached to 
      or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is 
      used by the signatory to sign, where the signatory is a natural person. 
      Like its handwritten counterpart in the offline world, an electronic 
      signature can be used, for instance, to electronically indicate that the 
      signatory has written the document, agreed with the content of the document, 
      or that the signatory was present as a witness.

  - term: electronic seal
    definition: >-
      An electronic seal is a data in electronic form, which is attached to or 
      logically associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the 
      latter's origin and integrity, where the creator of a seal is a legal 
      person (unlike the electronic signature that is issued by a natural person). 
      Electronic seals might serve as evidence that an electronic document was 
      issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the document's origin and 
      integrity.

  - term: digital signature
    definition: >-
      A digital signature refers to a mathematical and cryptographic concept 
      that is widely used to provide concrete and practical instances of 
      electronic signature. The definition given by ETSI TR 119 100 is that 
      of data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation of a data unit 
      that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and 
      integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery e.g. by the recipient.

    note: Technical concept (ETSI) — distinct from legal "electronic signature"


  - term: advanced electronic signature
    definition: >-
      An advanced electronic signature is an electronic signature which is 
      additionally: uniquely linked to and capable of identifying the signatory; 
      created in a way that allows the signatory to retain control; linked to 
      the document in a way that any subsequent change of the data is detectable.

  - term: advanced electronic seal
    definition: >-
      An advanced electronic seal is an electronic seal which is additionally: 
      uniquely linked to the creator of the seal; capable of identifying the 
      creator of the seal; created using electronic seal creation data that 
      the creator of the seal can, with a high level of confidence under its 
      control, use for electronic seal creation; and linked to the data to 
      which it relates in such a way that any subsequent change in the data 
      is detectable.

      A certificate for electronic signatures, issued by a Certificate 
      Authority (CA), is an electronic attestation which links electronic 
      signature validation data to a natural person and confirms at least 
      the name or the pseudonym of that person.

  - term: qualified signature creation device
    definition: >-
      A qualified signature/seal creation device (QSCD), by following stricter 
      requirements laid down in eIDAS, offers higher guarantees regarding the 
      protection (e.g. mitigating any kind of replication or forgery) of the 
      electronic signature/seal creation data (such as the private key) and 
      therefore higher legal certainty regarding the created qualified 
      electronic signatures/seals.
    sectionTitle: "What is a qualified signature/seal creation device (QSCD)?"
    section: what-is-a-qualified-signatureseal-creation-device-qscd

      protection (e.g. mitigating any kind of replication or forgery) of the 
      electronic signature/seal creation data (such as the private key) and

      A QSCD is not necessarily in the physical possession of the signatory/creator 
      of the seal but can also be remotely managed by a qualified trust service 
      provider (QTSP). This kind of QSCD is known as "remote QSCD". Those remote 
      QSCD offer an improved user experience while maintaining the legal certainty 
      offered by qualified electronic signatures/seals.
