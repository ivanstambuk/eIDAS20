# CAPITALIZATION RULES:
#   Use LOWERCASE for common nouns and technical terms:
#     ✓ attestation, attestation provider, attestation type
#     ✓ intermediary, holder, verifier, notification
#     ✓ selective disclosure, unlinkability, data minimisation
#     ✓ namespace, keystore, pseudonym, zero knowledge proof

  - term: without prejudice to
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase meaning "this provision applies, but it does not affect, 
      override, or diminish the rights, obligations, or provisions established 
      by [the referenced provision]." It signals that both rules coexist and 
      the referenced provision maintains its full force. Example: "Without 
      prejudice to paragraph 1" means paragraph 1 still fully applies.

    source: EU legal terminology
    note: Used 612 times across eIDAS 2.0 regulations

  - term: notwithstanding
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase meaning "despite" or "regardless of." It creates an 
      exception to a general rule, signaling that the provision it introduces 
      applies even though it may conflict with another provision. Example: 
      "Notwithstanding Article 5" means this provision applies even if 
      Article 5 would otherwise prevent it.
    source: EU legal terminology
    note: Creates explicit exceptions to general rules

  - term: for the purposes of
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase that introduces a definition or scope limitation specific 
      to a particular context. It signals that the meaning or application of

  - term: where applicable
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase indicating that a provision applies only in certain 
      circumstances or to certain entities. It creates conditional 
      applicability, meaning the requirement only takes effect when the 
      relevant conditions are met. Used to provide flexibility for diverse 
      situations across Member States.
    source: EU legal terminology
    note: Used 200 times for conditional requirements

  - term: insofar as
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase meaning "to the extent that" or "in so far as." It 
      creates a proportional or conditional scope, indicating that a 
      provision applies only to the degree that certain conditions are 
      met. Example: "insofar as necessary for the provision of the service" 
      limits the scope to what is strictly needed.
    source: EU legal terminology
    note: Creates proportional/conditional scope limitations

  - term: by way of derogation
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase introducing an exception or deviation from a general 
      rule. It signals that the provision temporarily or conditionally sets 
      aside the normal rules under specific circumstances. Unlike "notwithstanding,"

      conditions for its application.
    source: EU legal terminology
    note: Used for formal exceptions to general provisions

  - term: shall be deemed
    definition: >-
      A legal phrase creating a legal fiction or presumption. It establishes 
      that something is legally treated as true or equivalent to something 
      else, regardless of actual facts. Example: "shall be deemed to comply" 
      means the entity is legally presumed compliant if certain conditions 
      are met, even without further verification.

  # Core terms used extensively but not formally defined in eIDAS
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  - term: natural person
    definition: >-
      An individual human being, as opposed to a legal person (organization or 
      entity). In EU law, natural persons are the subjects of fundamental rights 
      protections, including data protection under GDPR. The term distinguishes 
      human individuals who can hold rights and bear obligations from artificial 
      legal entities. GDPR explicitly protects "personal data" relating to 
      identified or identifiable natural persons.
    source: GDPR Article 4(1), TFEU
    note: Fundamental EU concept; foundation of GDPR data subject definition

  - term: legal person
    definition: >-
      An entity that has legal personality under applicable law, such as a 
      company, corporation, association, or other organization. Legal persons 
      can enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued, independent of 
      their members or shareholders. In EU law, legal persons are typically 
      excluded from GDPR's personal data protections but can be controllers, 
      processors, relying parties, or trust service providers.
    source: TFEU Article 263(4), various EU directives
    note: Contrasts with natural person; includes companies and organizations

  - term: Union law
    definition: >-
      The legal framework of the European Union, comprising primary law 
      (founding treaties) and secondary law (regulations, directives, decisions). 
      Union law has supremacy over conflicting national law in areas where 
      Member States have transferred competence to the EU. Regulations apply 
      directly, while directives require transposition into national law.
    source: CJEU jurisprudence (Costa v. ENEL), EU Treaties
    note: Supranational law with primacy principle over national law

  - term: national law
    definition: >-
      The domestic legal system of each individual EU Member State, created 
      and enforced by that state's legislative, executive, and judicial bodies. 
      Where EU law applies, national law must conform to it (supremacy principle). 
      However, Member States retain competence in areas not transferred to the 
      EU. Many EU directives require implementation through national law.
    source: EU constitutional principles
    note: Member State domestic law; must conform to Union law where applicable

  - term: certification
    definition: >-
      The formal process by which an authorized body (conformity assessment body 
      or certification body) attests that a product, service, process, or 
      organization meets specified requirements or standards. In eIDAS context, 
      certification confirms that trust services, wallets, or devices comply with 
      regulatory requirements. Certification typically involves conformity

  - term: recertification
    definition: >-
      The process of renewing or revalidating a certification after it expires, 
      or when significant changes occur that may affect compliance. Recertification 
      ensures continued adherence to applicable requirements over time. In eIDAS, 
      qualified electronic signature creation devices must be recertified 
      periodically (typically every 5 years, with vulnerability assessments 
      every 2 years per Article 30).

  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  - term: natural or legal person
    definition: >-
      A fixed legal phrase indicating that a provision applies to any person, 
      whether an individual human being (natural person) or an entity with 
      legal personality such as a company or organization (legal person). 
      This formulation ensures universal applicability of rights, obligations, 
      or eligibility criteria to both individuals and organizations.

  - term: Union or national law
    definition: >-
      A fixed legal phrase indicating that provisions from either EU-level 
      legislation (Union law) or Member State domestic legislation (national 
      law) may apply to a given situation. This formulation acknowledges the 
      dual-layer legal structure of the EU, where both supranational and 
      national rules may govern the same subject matter.
    source: EU legal drafting convention
    note: 50 occurrences; signals dual legal source applicability

  - term: public or private
    definition: >-
      A fixed legal phrase indicating that a provision applies regardless of 
      whether the entity or sector involved is part of government/public 
      administration (public) or commercial/non-governmental (private). 
      Used to ensure equal treatment and applicability across all sectors.
    source: EU legal drafting convention
    note: 19 occurrences; sector-neutral applicability formula

  - term: directly or indirectly
    definition: >-
      A fixed legal phrase extending the scope of a provision to cover both 
      immediate effects (direct) and consequential or mediated effects 
      (indirect). In regulatory contexts, this ensures that obligations or 
      prohibitions cannot be circumvented through intermediaries, subsidiaries, 
      or layered arrangements.

  - term: Commission Communication
    definition: >-
      A non-binding policy document issued by the European Commission to outline 
      strategic intentions, policy priorities, or interpretive guidance. Unlike 
      Regulations (directly binding) or Directives (require transposition), 
      Communications are "soft law" instruments that signal the Commission's 
      policy direction without creating legal obligations. Examples include 
      "Shaping Europe's Digital Future" (COM(2020)67) which set the strategic 
      vision for the European Digital Identity Framework. While not legally 
      binding, Communications heavily influence subsequent legislation and 
      the interpretation of existing EU law.
