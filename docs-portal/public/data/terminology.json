Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and to Regulations (EU) 2019/881 and (EU) 2024/2847, Member States shall duly consider the criteria set out in the Annex I to this Regulation to assess whether a security breach or compromise of a wallet solution, of the validation mechanisms referred to in Article 5a(8) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, or of the electronic identification scheme under which the wallet solution is provided, is affecting their reliability or the reliability of other wallet solutions. 2. Where a Member State establishes, on the basis of the assessment laid down in paragraph 1, that a security breach or compromise is affecting the reliability of a wallet solution and suspends the provision and the use of that wallet solution, that Member State shall take the measures set out in Articles 4 and 5. Where a Member State withdraws the wallet solution, that Member State shall take the measures set out in Articles 8 and 9. 3. Where a Member State becomes aware of information relating to a possible security breach or compromise possibly affecting the reliability of one or more wallet solutions provided by another Member State, that Member State shall, without undue delay, communicate to the Commission and the single points of contact of the affected Member States designated pursuant to Article 46c(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on that fact. This communication shall include the information set out in Article 5(2). 4. The Member State receiving information provided pursuant to paragraph 3 shall take the measures set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 without undue delay. ### Article 4 **Suspension of the provision and the use of wallets and other remedies** 1. Member States shall ensure that no wallet units are provided, used or activated under the suspended wallet solution. 2. Member States shall evaluate whether revoking wallet unit attestations of the wallet units affected by the suspension of a wallet solution, or any other additional remedy, is necessary to react adequately to the security breach or compromise. 3. The measures set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be taken without undue delay, and in any event no later than 24 hours after the suspension of the provision and the use of the wallet solution affected by the security breach or compromise. 4. The measures set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not hinder affected wallet users from exercising their right to data portability set out in Article 5a(4), point (g) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. This is under the condition that this right may be exercised by wallet users without impairing the security of the critical assets of the affected wallet units, in particular considering the reasons for suspension and the need to ensure the effective protection of those assets against misuse. ### Article 5 **Information about suspensions and remedies** 1. Information in a clear, comprehensive and easily accessible manner about the suspension of the provision and the use of a wallet solution shall be provided, without undue delay and no later than 24 hours after the suspension of the provision and the use of the wallet solution, to: (a) the single points of contact designated pursuant to Article 46c(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014",
