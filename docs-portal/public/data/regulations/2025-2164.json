Therefore, qualified trust service providers are only to begin to provide a qualified trust service after the qualified status has been indicated in the trusted lists.\n\n- (2) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 \\[Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1505/oj).\\] lays down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists. Those specifications and formats leverage the specifications and requirements set out in standard ETSI TS 119 612 version 2.1.1.\n\n- (3) Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\\] amended Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 by introducing new qualified trust services, namely the management of remote qualified electronic signature creation devices, the management of remote qualified electronic seal creation devices, the issuance of qualified electronic attestation of attributes, the provision of qualified electronic archiving services, and the recording of electronic data in a qualified electronic ledger. Standard ETSI TS 119 612 has been updated to version 2.4.1, and now contains specifications that allow trusted lists to include and indicate the status of those new qualified trust services. The updated version 2.4.1 has also amended the specifications for the format of signatures or seals to be used by Member States to sign or seal their national trusted lists.\n\n- (4) Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 should be amended to update the reference to standard ETSI TS 119 612 to its newer version 2.4.1. As a result of this amendment, certain additional changes to that Implementing Decision are also required. Firstly, the information, to be referred to in the trusted lists, as regards the interpretation of the content of such lists, should be clarified to allow relying parties to interpret the information in the trusted lists. Secondly, the specifications related to the creation of the electronic signatures or seals that are to be applied to the trusted lists should be adapted to prevent certain known and reported vulnerabilities.\n\n- (5) To ensure that relying parties have sufficient time to adapt to the specifications set out in the Annex, the application of this Decision should be delayed.\n\n- (6) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\\] apply to all personal data processing activities under this Decision.\n\n- (7) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\\] and delivered its opinion on 8 August 2025 \\[EDPS Formal comments on the draft regarding the version of the standard on which the common template of the trusted lists is based | European Data Protection Supervisor.\\].\n\n- (8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n\nAnnex I to Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Decision.\n\n### Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\nThis Implementing Decision shall apply from\n\n---\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 October 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n",
