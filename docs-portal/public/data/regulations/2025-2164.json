Therefore, qualified trust service providers are only to begin to provide a qualified trust service after the qualified status has been indicated in the trusted lists.\n\n- (2) <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Decision 2015/1505\" data-celex=\"32015D1505\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1505/oj\">Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505</span> lays down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists. Those specifications and formats leverage the specifications and requirements set out in standard ETSI TS 119 612 version 2.1.1.\n\n- (3) Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span> amended <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"8\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> by introducing new qualified trust services, namely the management of remote qualified electronic signature creation devices, the management of remote qualified electronic seal creation devices, the issuance of qualified electronic attestation of attributes, the provision of qualified electronic archiving services, and the recording of electronic data in a qualified electronic ledger. Standard ETSI TS 119 612 has been updated to version 2.4.1, and now contains specifications that allow trusted lists to include and indicate the status of those new qualified trust services. The updated version 2.4.1 has also amended the specifications for the format of signatures or seals to be used by Member States to sign or seal their national trusted lists.\n\n- (4) Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 should be amended to update the reference to standard ETSI TS 119 612 to its newer version 2.4.1. As a result of this amendment, certain additional changes to that Implementing Decision are also required. Firstly, the information, to be referred to in the trusted lists, as regards the interpretation of the content of such lists, should be clarified to allow relying parties to interpret the information in the trusted lists. Secondly, the specifications related to the creation of the electronic signatures or seals that are to be applied to the trusted lists should be adapted to prevent certain known and reported vulnerabilities.\n\n- (5) To ensure that relying parties have sufficient time to adapt to the specifications set out in the Annex, the application of this Decision should be delayed.\n\n- (6) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to all personal data processing activities under this Decision.\n\n- (7) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"13\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</span> of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"5\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span> and delivered its opinion on 8 August 2025 \\[EDPS Formal comments on the draft regarding the version of the standard on which the common template of the trusted lists is based | European Data Protection Supervisor.\\].\n\n- (8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"8\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n\nAnnex I to Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Decision.\n\n### Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\nThis Implementing Decision shall apply from\n\n---\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 October 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\n\n## ANNEX\n\n**'**Scheme type/community/rules (clause 5.3.9)**\n\nThis field shall be mandatory and shall comply with the specifications from ETSI TS 119 612 clause 5.3.9.\n\nThis field shall only include UK English URIs.\n\nThis field shall include at least two URIs:\n\n- (1) A URI common to all Member States’ Trusted Lists pointing towards a descriptive text that shall be applicable to all Trusted Lists, as follows:\n     - URI: http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/schemerules/EUcommon\n   - 'A. ***Participation in a scheme***\n- (2) A URI specific to each Member State’s trusted list pointing towards a descriptive text that shall be applicable to this Member State trusted list:\n   - (a) http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/schemerules/CC where CC = the ISO 3166-1 \\[ISO 3166-1:2006: 'Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions Part 1: Country codes'.\\] alpha-2 Country Code used in the 'Scheme territory' field (clause 5.3.10)\n        - where users can obtain the referenced Member State’s specific policies/rules against which trust services included in the list are assessed, in compliance with the Member State’s supervisory regime and where applicable, approval scheme.\n        - where users can obtain a referenced Member State’s specific description about how to use and interpret the content of the trusted list with regard to the listed non-qualified trust services and/or to nationally defined trust services.
