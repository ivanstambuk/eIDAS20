With the European Digital Identity Wallets ('wallets') being the cornerstone of the framework, it aims at facilitating access to services across Member States, while ensuring the protection of personal data and privacy.\n\n- (2) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span>, or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to all personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (3) Article 5a(23) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> mandates the Commission, where necessary, to establish relevant specifications and procedures. This is achieved by means of four Implementing Regulations, dealing with protocols and interfaces: <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2982\" data-celex=\"32024R2982\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2982\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2982</span>, integrity and core functionalities: <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"5\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2979\" data-celex=\"32024R2979\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2979\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2979</span>, person identification data and electronic attestation of attributes: <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"6\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2977\" data-celex=\"32024R2977\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2977\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2977</span>, as well as the notifications to the Commission: <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"7\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2980\" data-celex=\"32024R2980\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2980\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2980</span>. This Regulation lays down the relevant requirements for Member States’ notifications of trusted entities that establish trustworthiness of the European Digital Identity Framework.\n\n- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. To ensure the highest level of harmonisation among Member States for the development and certification of the wallets, the technical specifications set out in this Regulation rely on the work carried out on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Framework \\[OJ L 210, 14.6.2021, p. 51, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.\\] and in particular the architecture and reference framework. In accordance with <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"16\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2024-1183?section=recital-75\">Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183</span> of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"8\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span>, the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, the architecture and reference framework, and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (5) To meet the objective of establishing a transparent and reliable source of information for authenticating entities in the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem, such as wallet providers, providers of person identification data and wallet-relying parties, Member States should notify the required information to the electronic system provided by the Commission. In line with the approach taken by <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"9\" data-short=\"Decision 2015/1984\" data-celex=\"32015D1984\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj\">Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1984</span> defining the circumstances, formats and procedures of notification with respect to electronic identification schemes applicable to electronic identification means, information should be provided by the Member States to the Commission in English. In this manner, descriptions of electronic identification schemes are available in English for all such schemes, irrespective of whether they relate to electronic identification means or to wallets.\n\n- (6) For the same objective of establishing information sources that enable the authentication of entities in the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem, the Commission should establish an infrastructure to make the information available to the public in a secure, human-readable, clear, and easily accessible manner, as well as in an electronically signed or sealed form suitable for automated processing, including by offering an application programming interface.\n\n- (7) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with <span

this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 48 of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting
