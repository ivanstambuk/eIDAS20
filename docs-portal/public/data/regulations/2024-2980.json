This Regulation lays down the relevant requirements for Member States’ notifications of trusted entities that establish trustworthiness of the European Digital Identity Framework.\n\n- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. To ensure the highest level of harmonisation among Member States for the development and certification of the wallets, the technical specifications set out in this Regulation rely on the work carried out on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Framework \\[OJ L 210, 14.6.2021, p. 51, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.\\] and in particular the architecture and reference framework.

In line with the approach taken by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1984 <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"9\" data-short=\"Decision 2015/1984\" data-celex=\"32015D1984\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj\">Decision 2015/1984</span> defining the circumstances, formats and procedures of notification with respect to electronic identification schemes applicable to electronic identification means, information should be provided by the Member States to the Commission in English. In this manner, descriptions of electronic identification schemes are available in English for all such schemes, irrespective of whether they relate to electronic identification means or to wallets.\n\n- (6) For the same objective of establishing information sources that enable the authentication of entities in the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem, the Commission should establish an infrastructure to make the information available to the public in a secure, human-readable, clear, and easily accessible manner, as well as in an electronically signed or sealed form suitable for automated processing, including by offering an application programming interface.\n\n- (7) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of
