With the European Digital Identity Wallets ('wallets') being the cornerstone of the framework, it aims at facilitating access to services across Member States, for natural and legal persons, while ensuring the protection of personal data and privacy.\n\n- (2) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to all personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (3) Article 5a(23) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> mandates the Commission, where necessary, to establish relevant specifications and procedures. This is achieved by means of four Implementing Regulations, dealing with protocols and interfaces: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2982 <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2982\" data-celex=\"32024R2982\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2982\">Regulation 2024/2982</span>, integrity and core functionalities: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2979 <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2979\" data-celex=\"32024R2979\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2979\">Regulation 2024/2979</span>, person identification data and electronic attestation of attributes: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2977 <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"5\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2977\" data-celex=\"32024R2977\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2977\">Regulation 2024/2977</span>, as well as the notifications to the Commission: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2980 <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"6\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/2980\" data-celex=\"32024R2980\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/implementing-acts/2024-2980\">Regulation 2024/2980</span>. This Regulation lays down the relevant requirements for the integrity and core functionalities of European Digital Identity Wallets.\n\n- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. To ensure the highest level of harmonisation among Member States for the development and certification of the wallets, the technical specifications set out in this Regulation rely on the work carried out on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Framework \\[OJ L 210, 14.6.2021, p. 51, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.\\] and in particular the architecture and reference framework. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"7\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulations/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span>, the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, the Architecture and Reference Framework, and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (5) In order to ensure precise communication, technical differentiation, and clear assignment of responsibilities, it is necessary to distinguish between different components and configurations of wallets. A wallet solution should be understood as the complete system provided by a wallet provider that is necessary to operate a wallet. This should include the software and hardware components, as well as services, settings, and configurations needed to ensure the wallet functions properly. A wallet solution may be located on the users’ devices and environments and the provider’s backend structure. A wallet unit should be understood as a specific setup of the wallet solution for an individual user. It should include the application installed on a wallet user's device or environment that the wallet user interacts with directly (the 'wallet instance') and the necessary security features to protect the users’ data and transactions. These security features should involve special software or hardware to encrypt and safeguard sensitive information. A wallet instance should be part of the wallet unit and allow the wallet user to access the functionalities of their wallet.\n\n- (6) Wallet secure cryptographic applications as separate specialised components within a wallet unit are necessary not only for the protection of critical assets, such as cryptographic private keys, but also for the provision of crucial functionalities, such as the presentation of electronic attestations of attributes. The use of common technical specifications may facilitate the access to embedded secure elements by wallet providers. Wallet secure cryptographic applications may be provided in various ways and to various kinds of wallet secure cryptographic devices. Where custom wallet secure cryptographic applications are provided by wallet providers as Java Card applets to embedded secure elements, wallet providers should follow the standards listed in Annex I or equivalent technical specifications.\n\n- (7) Wallet units are to enable providers of person identification data or electronic attestations of attributes to verify that they are issuing this data or attestations to genuine wallet units of the wallet user.\n\n- (8) To ensure data protection by design and by default, the wallets should be provided with available state-of-the-art privacy enhancing techniques. These features should provide the possibility that wallets can be used without the wallet user being trackable across different wallet-relying parties, if applicable in the usage scenario. For instance, wallet providers should consider state-of-the-art privacy mitigating measures in relation to wallet unit attestations, such as using ephemeral wallet unit attestations or batch issuance. In addition, embedded disclosure policies should warn the wallet users against inappropriate or illegal disclosure of attributes from electronic attestations of attributes.\n\n- (9) Wallet unit attestations should make it possible for wallet-relying parties which request attributes from wallet units, to verify the validity status of the wallet unit that they are communicating with, as wallet unit attestations are to be revoked when a wallet unit is no longer considered valid. The information regarding the validity status of the wallet units should be made available in an interoperable manner, to ensure that it can be used by all wallet-relying parties. Moreover, for cases where wallet users lost their wallet units or no longer have control over it, wallet providers should enable wallet users to request the revocation of their wallet unit. To ensure the privacy and unlinkability, Member States should employ privacy preserving techniques also for the wallet unit attestation. This may include the usage of multiple wallet unit attestations for different purposes, disclosing only the minimally relevant information about the wallet necessary for a transaction, or to limit the lifetime of the wallet unit attestation as an alternative to the use of revocation identifiers.\n\n- (10) In order to ensure that all wallets are technically capable of receiving and presenting person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes in cross-border scenarios without impairing interoperability, wallets should support predetermined types of data formats and selective disclosure. As set out in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> selective disclosure is a concept empowering the owner of data to disclose only certain parts of a larger data set, in order for the receiving entity to obtain only such information as is necessary for the provision of a service requested by a user. As the wallets are to enable the user to selectively disclose attributes, the standards listed in Annex II should be implemented in a way that enables this feature of the wallets. In addition, wallets may support other formats and functionalities to facilitate specific use cases.\n\n- (11) Logging transactions is an important tool to provide transparency, in the form of providing an overview of the transactions to the wallet user. Furthermore, logs should be used to enable the swift and easy sharing of certain information, at the request of the wallet user, with the competent supervisory authorities established pursuant Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in case of suspicious behaviour of wallet-relying parties.\n\n- (12) For a wallet user to be able to sign electronically, a qualified certificate, which is bound to a qualified electronic signature creation device, should be issued to the wallet user. The wallet user should have access to a signature creation application. While the issuance of qualified certificates is a service of qualified trust service providers, wallet providers or other entities should be able to provide the other components. For instance, qualified electronic signature creation devices may be managed by qualified trust service providers as a service or they may be local to the wallet user’s device, for example, as a smartcard. Similarly, signature creation applications may be integrated in the wallet instance, be a separate app on the wallet user’s device or be provided remotely.\n\n- (13) Data export and portability objects can log the person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes that have been issued to a particular wallet unit. These objects allow wallet users to extract the relevant data from their wallet unit in order to strengthen their right to data portability. Wallet providers are encouraged to use the same technical solutions to also implement backup and recovery processes for wallet units, making it possible to recover lost wallet units or to transfer information from one wallet provider to another, where appropriate and insofar as this can be done without impairing the right to data protection and the security of the digital identity ecosystem.\n\n- (14) The generation of wallet-relying party specific pseudonyms should enable wallet users to authenticate themselves without providing wallet-relying parties with unnecessary information. As set out in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, wallet users are not to be hindered from accessing services under a pseudonym, where there is no legal requirement for legal identity for authentication. Therefore, the wallets are to include a functionality to generate user-chosen and managed pseudonyms, to authenticate when accessing online services. The implementation of the specifications set out in Annex V should enable these functionalities accordingly. Further, wallet-relying parties are not to request users to provide any data other than those indicated for the intended use of wallets in the relying party register. Wallet users should be enabled to verify the registration data of relying parties at any point in time.\n\n- (15) As set out in Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, Member States are not, directly or indirectly, to limit access to public or private services to natural or legal persons not opting to use wallets and are to make available appropriate alternative solutions.\n\n- (16) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"8\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span>, and delivered its opinion on 30 September 2024.\n\n- (17) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee referred to in Article 48 of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"false\"

This Regulation lays down the relevant requirements for the integrity and core functionalities of European Digital Identity Wallets.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-4\" data-recital=\"4\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. To ensure the highest level of harmonisation among Member States for the development and certification of the wallets, the technical specifications set out in this Regulation rely on the work carried out on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Framework [OJ L 210, 14.6.2021, p. 51, ELI: <a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.%5C\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.\\</a>] and in particular the architecture and reference framework. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"7\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulations/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span>, the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, the Architecture and Reference Framework, and to follow the best practices on the internal market.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-5\" data-recital=\"5\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(5) In order to ensure precise communication, technical differentiation, and clear assignment of responsibilities, it is necessary to distinguish between different components and configurations of wallets. A wallet solution should be understood as the complete system provided by a wallet provider that is necessary to operate a wallet. This should include the software and hardware components, as well as services, settings, and configurations needed to ensure the wallet functions properly. A wallet solution may be located on the users’ devices and environments and the provider’s backend structure. A wallet unit should be understood as a specific setup of the wallet solution for an individual user. It should include the application installed on a wallet user's device or environment that the wallet user interacts with directly (the 'wallet instance') and the necessary security features to protect the users’ data and transactions. These security features should involve special software or hardware to encrypt and safeguard sensitive information. A wallet instance should be part of the wallet unit and allow the wallet user to access the functionalities of their wallet.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-6\" data-recital=\"6\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(6) Wallet secure cryptographic applications as separate specialised components within a wallet unit are necessary not only for the protection of critical assets, such as cryptographic private keys, but also for the provision of crucial functionalities, such as the presentation of electronic attestations of attributes. The use of common technical specifications may facilitate the access to embedded secure elements by wallet providers. Wallet secure cryptographic applications may be provided in various ways and to various kinds of wallet secure cryptographic devices. Where custom wallet secure cryptographic applications are provided by wallet providers as Java Card applets to embedded secure elements, wallet providers should follow the standards listed in Annex I or equivalent technical specifications.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-7\" data-recital=\"7\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(7) Wallet units are to enable providers of person identification data or electronic attestations of attributes to verify that they are issuing this data or attestations to genuine wallet units of the wallet user.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-8\" data-recital=\"8\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(8) To ensure data protection by design and by default, the wallets should be provided with available state-of-the-art privacy enhancing techniques. These features should provide the possibility that wallets can be used without the wallet user being trackable across different wallet-relying parties, if applicable in the usage scenario. For instance, wallet providers should consider state-of-the-art privacy mitigating measures in relation to wallet unit attestations, such as using ephemeral wallet unit attestations or batch issuance. In addition, embedded disclosure policies should warn the wallet users against inappropriate or illegal disclosure of attributes from electronic attestations of attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-9\" data-recital=\"9\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(9) Wallet unit attestations should make it possible for wallet-relying parties which request attributes from wallet units, to verify the validity status of the wallet unit that they are communicating with, as wallet unit attestations are to be revoked when a wallet unit is no longer considered valid. The information regarding the validity status of the wallet units should be made available in an interoperable manner, to ensure that it can be used by all wallet-relying parties. Moreover, for cases where wallet users lost their wallet units or no longer have control over it, wallet providers should enable wallet users to request the revocation of their wallet unit. To ensure the privacy and unlinkability, Member States should employ privacy preserving techniques also for the wallet unit attestation. This may include the usage of multiple wallet unit attestations for different purposes, disclosing only the minimally relevant information about the wallet necessary for a transaction, or to limit the lifetime of the wallet unit attestation as an alternative to the use of revocation identifiers.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-10\" data-recital=\"10\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(10) In order to ensure that all wallets are technically capable of receiving and presenting person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes in cross-border scenarios without impairing interoperability, wallets should support predetermined types of data formats and selective disclosure. As set out in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> selective disclosure is a concept empowering the owner of data to disclose only certain parts of a larger data set, in order for the receiving entity to obtain only such information as is necessary for the provision of a service requested by a user. As the wallets are to enable the user to selectively disclose attributes, the standards listed in Annex II should be implemented in a way that enables this feature of the wallets. In addition, wallets may support other formats and functionalities to facilitate specific use cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-11\" data-recital=\"11\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(11) Logging transactions is an important tool to provide transparency, in the form of providing an overview of the transactions to the wallet user. Furthermore, logs should be used to enable the swift and easy sharing of certain information, at the request of the wallet user, with the competent supervisory authorities established pursuant Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in case of suspicious behaviour of wallet-relying parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-12\" data-recital=\"12\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(12) For a wallet user to be able to sign electronically, a qualified certificate, which is bound to a qualified electronic signature creation device, should be issued to the wallet user. The wallet user should have access to a signature creation application. While the issuance of qualified certificates is a service of qualified trust service providers, wallet providers or other entities should be able to provide the other components. For instance, qualified electronic signature creation devices may be managed by qualified trust service providers as a service or they may be local to the wallet user’s device, for example, as a smartcard. Similarly, signature creation applications may be integrated in the wallet instance, be a separate app on the wallet user’s device or be provided remotely.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-13\" data-recital=\"13\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(13) Data export and portability objects can log the person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes that have been issued to a particular wallet unit. These objects allow wallet users to extract the relevant data from their wallet unit in order to strengthen their right to data portability. Wallet providers are encouraged to use the same technical solutions to also implement backup and recovery processes for wallet units, making it possible to recover lost wallet units or to transfer information from one wallet provider to another, where appropriate and insofar as this can be done without impairing the right to data protection and the security of the digital identity ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-14\" data-recital=\"14\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(14) The generation of wallet-relying party specific pseudonyms should enable wallet users to authenticate themselves without providing wallet-relying parties with unnecessary information. As set out in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, wallet users are not to be hindered from accessing services under a pseudonym, where there is no legal requirement for legal identity for authentication. Therefore, the wallets are to include a functionality to generate user-chosen and managed pseudonyms, to authenticate when accessing online services. The implementation of the specifications set out in Annex V should enable these functionalities accordingly. Further, wallet-relying parties are not to request users to provide any data other than those indicated for the intended use of wallets in the relying party register. Wallet users should be enabled to verify the registration data of relying parties at any point in time.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-15\" data-recital=\"15\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(15) As set out in Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, Member States are not, directly or indirectly, to limit access to public or private services to natural or legal persons not opting to use wallets and are to make available appropriate alternative solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-16\" data-recital=\"16\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(16) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in
