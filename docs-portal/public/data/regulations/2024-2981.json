Those certification requirements need to be harmonised across Member States in order to prevent market fragmentation and to build a robust framework.\n\n- (2) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (3) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. To ensure the highest level of harmonisation among Member States for the development and certification of the wallets, the technical specifications set out in this Regulation rely on the work carried out on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Identity Framework \\[OJ L 210, 14.6.2021, p. 51, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.\\] and in particular the Architecture and Reference Framework which is part of it. In accordance with <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"26\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2024-1183?section=recital-75\">recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183</span> of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span>, the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, the Architecture and Reference Framework and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (4) In order to attest conformity to cybersecurity requirements included in the certification framework, the certification of wallet solutions should refer to, where available and relevant, European cybersecurity certification schemes established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Regulation 2019/881\" data-celex=\"32019R0881\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj\">Regulation 2019/881</span>. In the absence of such schemes, or when they partially cover cybersecurity requirements, this Regulation sets out the general requirements applying to national certification schemes, covering functional, cybersecurity, and data protection requirements.\n\n- (5) Pursuant to Article 5a(11) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, the wallets are to be certified against assurance level high as set out in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, as well as <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"5\" data-short=\"Regulation 2015/1502\" data-celex=\"32015R1502\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502</span>. That assurance level has to be reached by the overall wallet solution. Under this Regulation, some components of the wallet solution may be certified at a lower assurance level, provided this is duly justified and without prejudice to the assurance level high reached by the overall solution.\n\n- (6) All national certification schemes should assign a scheme owner who will be responsible for the development and maintenance of the certification scheme. The scheme owner may be a conformity assessment body, a governmental body or authority, a trade association, a group of conformity assessment bodies, or any appropriate body and can be different than the body operating the national certification scheme.\n\n- (7) The object of certification should include the software components of the wallet solution, such as the wallet instance. The wallet secure cryptographic application ('WSCA'), the wallet secure cryptographic device ('WSCD') and the platforms on which these software components are executed, while being part of the operating environment, should only be included in the object of certification when they are provided by the wallet solution. In other cases, and in particular when these devices and platforms are provided by end users, providers should establish assumptions on the wallet solution’s operating environment, including on these devices and platforms, and implement measures to confirm that these assumptions are verified in practice. In order to ensure protection of critical assets through hardware and system software used to manage and protect cryptographic keys created, stored or processed by the WSCD, the WSCD needs to satisfy high standards of certification as reflected in international standards such as Common Criteria ('EUCC'), established in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"6\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/482\" data-celex=\"32024R0482\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/482/oj\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/482</span>, by EAL4 evaluation and advanced methodical vulnerability analysis, such as comparable to AVA_VAN.5. These certification standards should be used at the latest when certification of the conformity of wallets is carried out following a European cybersecurity certification scheme adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881.\n\n- (8) Fully mobile, secure and user-friendly wallets are supported by the availability of standardised and certified tamper-resistant solutions, such as embedded secure elements, external devices such as smartcards, or embedded SIM platforms in mobile devices. It is important to ensure the timely access to embedded secure elements for national eID means and wallets and to coordinate efforts by Member States in this area. The European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 46e(1) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> ('Cooperation Group'), should therefore establish a dedicated subgroup for this purpose. Consulting relevant stakeholders, this subgroup should agree on a joint roadmap for access to embedded secure elements to be considered by the Commission for the review report on the <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>. In order to facilitate the uptake of the wallet at national level, the Commission should furthermore, in cooperation with Member States, develop and continuously update a manual for use cases as part of the Architecture and Reference Framework.\n\n- (9) The object of certification of national certification schemes should also include the processes that are used to provide and operate the wallet solution, even if the definition or execution of those processes are subcontracted to third parties. In order to demonstrate that the processes satisfy the schemes’ requirements, assurance information is allowed to be used as evidence, provided that a dependency analysis is used to determine if the assurance information is sufficient. Assurance information comes in many different forms, including reports and certificates of conformity, which can be private, national, European or international, based on standards or on technical specifications. The objective of the dependency analysis is to assess the quality of the assurance information available about a wallet’s components.\n\n- (10) Following procedures established for this purpose, the Cooperation Group should be able to provide opinions and recommendations on the draft national certification schemes submitted to it. These national certification schemes should be specific to the wallet architecture and there should be specific profiles for each specific architecture supported.\n\n- (11) In order to ensure a common understanding of, and harmonised approach to, the assessment of the most critical risks that might affect the provision and operation of wallets, a register of risks and threats that should be taken into consideration when designing wallet solutions independently of their specific architecture should be drawn-up. The cybersecurity objectives described in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, such as confidentiality, integrity and availability of the wallet solution, as well as user and data privacy, should be borne in mind when identifying which risks should be included in the register. Due consideration of risks and threats included in this risk register should be part of the requirements of national certification schemes. To keep in line with the continuously evolving threat landscape, the risk register should be maintained and regularly updated in collaboration with the Cooperation Group.\n\n- (12) When establishing their certification schemes, scheme owners should perform a risk assessment to refine and complement the risks and threats listed in the register with risks and threats specific to the architecture or implementation of the wallet solution. The risk assessment should consider how the applicable risks and threats can be appropriately treated. Wallet providers should complement the scheme’s risk assessment to identify any risks and threats specific to their implementation and propose appropriate treatment measures for evaluation by the certification body.\n\n- (13) To demonstrate that a wallet solution architecture meets the applicable security requirements, each architecture-specific scheme or profile should contain at least a description of the wallet solution architecture, a list of security requirements applicable to the wallet solution architecture, an evaluation plan to confirm that a wallet solution based on this architecture meets those requirements and a risk assessment. National certification schemes should require wallet providers to demonstrate how the design of the wallet solution that they provide matches the reference architecture and details the security controls and validation plans for the specific wallet solution. National certification schemes should also define a conformity assessment activity to verify that the wallet design properly reflects the selected profile’s reference architecture. National certification schemes should comply with the requirements set out in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"30\" data-short=\"Regulation 2019/881\" data-celex=\"32019R0881\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj\">Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881</span>, except for its points (e) and (f), related to logging.\n\n- (14) Concerning the certification of products, certificates of conformity issued under the EU cybersecurity certification scheme on EUCC, and certificates of conformity issued under national certification schemes in the context of the SOG-IS Mutual Recognition Agreement, should be allowed to be used. Furthermore, other national certification schemes should be allowed to be used for less sensitive product components, such as those established following the standard CEN EN 17640 for fixed time cybersecurity evaluation methodology.\n\n- (15) The EU Digital Identity Wallet Trust Mark ('Trust Mark') should be used to indicate in a clear, simple and recognisable manner that a wallet has been provided in accordance with <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>. Therefore, it should be considered as a mark of conformity for a wallet solution certified under national certification schemes. National certification schemes should not define any other marks of conformity.\n\n- (16) In order to discourage fraud, national certification schemes should define actions to be taken where certification under the scheme is being claimed fraudulently.\n\n- (17) To ensure an efficient management of vulnerability notifications, providers of wallet solutions and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided should define and implement processes to evaluate the severity and potential impact of vulnerabilities. National certification schemes should set a threshold over which the certification body is to be notified. Such notification requirement should not affect the criteria established by data protection legislation and Member States’ data protection authorities for notification on personal data breaches. Possible synergies could be established between the mandatory notification of breach or compromise of the wallet solutions and the notification of personal data breaches pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The certification body’s assessment of a vulnerability impact analysis report should be without prejudice to a data protection authority’s assessment of a data protection impact assessment pursuant to Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\n- (18) The providers of wallet solutions and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided should notify the scheme owner of any justifications for exceptions to the vulnerability assessment required for the evaluation of the WSCD and WSCA, as set out in Annex IV.\n\n- (19) The cancellation of a certificate of conformity might have severe consequences such as the revocation of all deployed wallet units. Therefore, certification bodies should only consider cancellation if an unremedied vulnerability is likely to significantly affect the reliability of the wallet solution or the reliability of another wallet solution.\n\n- (20) A specific process for the update of national certification schemes should be put in place to manage the transition between successive releases of the schemes, in particular in relation to actions to be taken by the certificate holder regarding upcoming evaluations, maintenance, recertification and special evaluations.\n\n- (21) To facilitate transparency, wallet providers should publicly share security information about their wallet solution.\n\n- (22) Where national certification schemes rely on assurance information from other certification schemes or sources, a dependency analysis should be carried out to verify that the assurance documentation, for instance assurance reports and certificates of conformity, is available and adequate for the wallet solutions and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided. The basis for this dependency analysis should be the risk assessment of the wallet solutions and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided. The evaluation should determine whether the assurance documentation available for a given wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme under which it is provided is adequate to provide assurance corresponding to the targeted evaluation level. The evaluation should also update the dependency analysis, or entirely re-evaluate it, where necessary.\n\n- (23) Certification bodies should issue certificates of conformity in national certification schemes, together with a publicly available certification report, as referred to in Article 5d(2), point (a), of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>. The associated certification assessment report should be made available to the Cooperation Group.\n\n- (24) National certification schemes should set out yearly surveillance evaluation to ensure that the processes around the management and maintenance of the wallets are operating effectively, meaning that they operate as defined in the policies determining the processes. The biennial vulnerability assessment is a requirement stemming from <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"18\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, to ensure that the wallet solution continues to cover appropriately the cybersecurity risks and threats identified in the risk register, including any evolution of the threat landscape. The notions of surveillance evaluations, recertification evaluations and special evaluations should be in accordance with EN ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015.\n\n- (25) A certification cycle ends with the expiry of the certificate of conformity, or with the issuance of a new certificate of conformity following a successful recertification evaluation. The recertification evaluation should include an evaluation of all components of the object of certification, including an evaluation of the effectiveness and, where applicable, a vulnerability assessment. During recertification, it should be possible to reuse results from previous evaluations on components that have not changed.\n\n- (26) When a European cybersecurity certification scheme is adopted, national certification schemes with the same scope should cease issuing certifications after a defined transition period as referred to in <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"31\" data-short=\"Regulation 2019/881\" data-celex=\"32019R0881\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj\">Article 57(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881</span>.\n\n- (27) National certification schemes should rely on existing frameworks and reuse evidence as appropriate in order to ensure harmonisation and interoperability.

The **high-level risks** (Section I) are related to the use of wallets by users and relying parties, and they are associated to direct threats targeting the assets of wallets. In addition, a few **system-level risks** (Section II) to wallets are identified, which would typically result from a combination of threats applying to the entire wallet system.\n\nThe register also identifies **technical threats** (Section III) targeting the implementation of the wallet solution. These threats are related to the high-level risks in the sense that each one of them could be used to trigger many high-level risks.\n\nFinally, the register **lists direct threats to the wallets**, and each one is associated to a (non-exhaustive) selection of risks (Section IV).\n\n| Risk type | Risk ID | Related risk titles |\n|---|---|---|\n| **High-level risks to the wallets** | R1 | Creation or use of an existing electronic identity |\n|  | R2 | Creation or use of a fake electronic identity |\n|  | R3 | Creation or use of fake attributes |\n|  | R4 | Identify theft |\n|  | R5 | Data theft |\n|  | R6 | Data disclosure |\n|  | R7 | Data manipulation |\n|  | R8 | Data loss |\n|  | R9 | Unauthorised transaction |\n|  | R10 | Transaction manipulation |\n|  | R11 | Repudiation |\n|  | R12 | Transaction data disclosure |\n|  | R13 | Service disruption |\n|  | R14 | Surveillance |\n| **System-related risks** | SR1 | Wholesale surveillance |\n|  | SR2 | Reputational damage |\n|  | SR3 | Legal non-compliance |\n\n| Threat type | Threat ID | Related threat titles | Subcategories of threats |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Technical threat** | TT1 | Physical attacks | 1.1 *Theft* |\n|  |  |  | 1.2 *Information leakage* |\n|  |  |  | 1.3 *Tampering* |\n|  | TT2 | Errors and misconfigurations | 2.1 *Errors made when managing an IT system* |\n|  |  |  | 2.2 *Application-level errors or usage errors* |\n|  |  |  | 2.3 *Development-time errors and system misconfigurations* |\n|  | TT3 | Use of unreliable resources | 3.1 *Erroneous use or configuration of wallet components* |\n|  | TT4 | Failure and outages | 4.1 *Failure or dysfunction of equipment, devices or systems* |\n|  |  |  | 4.2 *Loss of resources* |\n|  |  |  | 4.3 *Loss of support services* |\n|  | TT5 | Malicious actions | 5.1 *Interception of information* |\n|  |  |  | 5.2 *Phishing and spoofing* |\n|  |  |  | 5.3 *Replay of messages* |\n|  |  |  | 5.4 *Brute-force attack* |\n|  |  |  | 5.5 *Software vulnerabilities* |\n|  |  |  | 5.6 *Supply chain attacks* |\n|  |  |  | 5.7 *Malware* |\n|  |  |  | 5.8 *Random number prediction* |\n\n**SECTION I**\n\n| Column 1 |\n|---|\n| **R1. Creation or use of an existing electronic identity** |\n| Creation or use of an existing electronic identity is defined as the creation of an electronic identity in a wallet that exists in the real world and is assigned to another user. By essence, this risk leads to the risks of Identity theft (R4), and Unauthorised transactions (R9). |\n| **R2. Creation or use of a fake electronic identity** |\n| Creation or use of a fake electronic identity is defined as the creation of an electronic identity in a wallet that does not exist in the real world. |\n| **R3. Creation or use of fake attributes** |\n| Creation or use of fake attributes is defined as the creation or use of attributes that cannot be validated to be issued by the claimed provider and cannot be trusted. |\n| **R4. Identify theft** |\n| Identity theft is defined as the unauthorised acquisition of the wallet unit or loss of authentication factors enabling to impersonate a person. |\n| **R5. Data theft** |\n| Data theft is defined as the unauthorised extraction of data. Data theft is also associated to threats, such as data interception (unauthorised capture of data in transit) and data decryption (unauthorised decoding of encrypted data), which are likely to lead in some cases to Data disclosure (R6). |\n| **R6. Data disclosure** |\n| Data disclosure is defined as the unauthorised exposure of personal data including special categories of personal data. The privacy breach risk is very similar when considered from a privacy rather than security viewpoint. |\n| **R7. Data manipulation** |\n| Data manipulation is defined as the unauthorised alteration of data. |\n| **R8. Data loss** |\n| Data loss is defined as the situation where data stored in the wallet is lost through misuse or malicious action. This risk is often a secondary risk of Data manipulation (R7) or Service disruption (R13), where all or part of the data cannot be restored. |\n| **R9. Unauthorised transaction** |\n| Unauthorised transactions are defined as operational activities conducted without the permission or knowledge of the wallet user. In many cases, an unauthorised transaction can lead to Identity theft (R4) or Data disclosure (R6). It is also related to unauthorised transactions, such as the misuse of cryptographic keys. |\n| **R10. Transaction manipulation** |\n| Transaction manipulation is defined as the unauthorised alteration of operations in the wallet. Transaction manipulation is an attack on integrity, and it is related to a data integrity breach. |\n| **R11. Repudiation** |\n| Repudiation is defined as a situation where a stakeholder can deny performing an action or being involved in a transaction, and other stakeholders do not have proper evidence to contradict them. |\n| **R12. Transaction data disclosure** |\n| Transaction data disclosure is defined as the disclosure of information related to information on a transaction between stakeholders. |\n| **R13. Service disruption** |\n| Service disruption is defined as an interruption or degradation in the normal operation of the wallet. A specific kind of service disruption is user lock-out, defined as the inability of a user to access their account or their wallet. |\n| **R14. Surveillance** |\n| Surveillance, or monitoring, is defined as the unauthorised tracking or observation of a wallet user’s activities, communication, or data. Surveillance is often related to inference, which is defined as the deduction of sensitive or personal information from seemingly innocuous data. |\n\n**SECTION II**\n\nThese risks are not used in the list of threats, as they are usually the consequence of multiple threats, repeated in a way that threatens the full system.\n\n| Column 1 |\n|---|\n| **SR1. Wholesale surveillance** |\n| Wholesale surveillance is defined as the tracking or observation of the activities of many users through their wallet’s communication or data. Wholesale surveillance is often associated to surveillance (R14) and inference at a global scale, where information about many users is combined to deduce sensitive or personal data about users or to identify statistical trends that can be used to design further attacks. |\n| **SR2. Reputational damage** |\n| Reputational damage is defined as the harm caused to an organisation’s or governmental body’s reputation. Reputational damage will also stem from other risks when a breach or incident is covered by media and paints the organisation under an unfavourable light. Reputational damage can lead to further risks, such as loss of trust, stemming from the user’s reasonable doubts, and loss of ecosystem, when the full ecosystem collapses. |\n| **SR3. Legal non-compliance** |\n| Legal non-compliance is defined as a situation when relevant laws, regulations or standards cannot be adhered to. In the context of the wallet, as security and privacy of the solution are legal requirements, all threats are likely to lead to some kind of legal non-compliance. |\n\n**SECTION III**\n\nThe technical threats are not all linked to specific risks on the wallets, because many of them are means that could be used to implement attacks corresponding to many different risks.\n\n| Column 1 |\n|---|\n| **TT1. Physical attacks** |\n| 1.1 *Theft*Theft is defined as the theft of devices that may alter the wallet’s proper functioning (in case the device is stolen and the wallet unit is not adequately protected). This may contribute to many risks, including Identity theft (R4), Data theft (R5), and Unauthorised transactions (R9). |\n| 1.2 *Information leakage*Information leakage is defined as unauthorised access, information exposure, or sharing after physical access to the wallet. This may contribute in particular to Data Disclosure (R6) and Data theft (R5). |\n| 1.3 *Tampering*Tampering is defined as violating the integrity of one or multiple components of the wallet unit, or of the components the wallet unit relies on, e.g., the user device or its operating system. This may contribute in particular to Data manipulation (R7), Data loss (R8) and Transaction manipulation (R10). When tampering targets software components, it may contribute to many risks. |\n| **TT2. Errors and misconfigurations** |\n| 2.1 *Errors made when managing an IT system*Errors made when managing an IT system are defined as information leakage, sharing or damage caused by misuse of IT assets by users (lack of awareness of application features) or by improper configuration or management of IT assets. |\n| 2.2 *Application-level errors or usage errors*Application-level errors or usage errors are defined as dysfunctions of the application due to an error in the application itself or to an error by one of the users (wallet users and relying parties). |\n| 2.3 *Development-time errors and system misconfigurations*Development-time errors and system misconfigurations are defined as dysfunction or vulnerabilities caused by improperly developed or configured IT assets or business processes (inadequate specifications of IT products, inadequate usability, insecure interfaces, improper policy and procedure flows, design errors). |\n| **TT3. Use of unreliable resources** |\n| The use of unreliable resources is defined as an activity leading to unintentional damage due to ill-defined trust relationships, such as trusting a third-party provider without sufficient assurance. |\n| 3.1 *Erroneous use or configuration of wallet components*An erroneous use or configuration of wallet components is defined as unintentional damage to wallet components due to an erroneous use or misconfiguration by wallet users or by insufficiently trained developers, or due to lack of adaptation to changes in the threat landscape, typically the use of vulnerable third-party components or runtime platforms. |\n| **TT4. Failure and outages** |\n| 4.1 *Failure or dysfunction of equipment, devices or systems*A failure or dysfunction of equipment is defined as unintentional damage to IT assets due to a failure or dysfunction of equipment, including the provider’s infrastructure and the user devices. |\n| 4.2 *Loss of resources*The loss of resources is defined as an outage or dysfunction due to unavailability of such resources, e.g., as maintenance parts. |\n| 4.3 *Loss of support services*The loss of support services is defined as an outage or dysfunction due to unavailability of support services required for proper operation of the system, including network connectivity of the provider’s infrastructure and of the user device. |\n| **TT5. Malicious actions** |\n| 5.1 *Interception of information*The interception of information is defined as the capture of information improperly secured in transmission, including man-in-the-middle attacks. |\n| 5.2 *Phishing and spoofing*Phishing is defined as the capture of information provided by the user following a deceptive interaction, often associate to the spoofing of legitimate communication means and websites. These threats target the user and typically contribute to Identity theft (R4) and Unauthorised transactions (R9), often through Data theft (R5) or Data disclosure (R6). |\n| 5.3 *Replay of messages*Replay of messages is defined as the reuse of previously intercepted messages to perform unauthorised transactions, often at protocol level. This technical threat mainly contributes to unauthorised transactions, which may then lead to other risks, depending on the transaction. |\n| 5.4 *Brute-force attack*Brute-force attack is defined as a breach of security, often confidentiality, by performing a large number of interactions until the responses provide valuable information. |\n| 5.5 *Software vulnerabilities*The threat related to software vulnerabilities is a breach of security through exploitation of a software vulnerability in the components of the wallet or in the software and hardware components used in the implementation of the wallet, including published vulnerabilities and unpublished (0-day) vulnerabilities. |\n| 5.6 *Supply chain attacks*A supply chain attack is defined as a breach of security through attacks perpetrated on the supplier of the wallet provider or of its users to enable further attacks on the wallet itself. |\n| 5.7 *Malware*Malware is defined as a breach of security through malicious applications performing unwanted and illegitimate actions on the wallet. |\n| 5.8 *Random number prediction*Random number prediction is defined as the enablement of brute-force attacks through partial or complete prediction of generated random numbers. |\n\n**SECTION IV**\n\nThis last section presents a selection of typical threat scenarios specific to the wallets, which are mapped to the key related high-level risks, as listed above. This list indicates threats that need to be covered, but it does not constitute an exhaustive list of threats, which depends greatly on the architecture of the selected wallet solution and on the evolution of the threat environment. Additionally, in the risk assessment and proposed measures, the wallet provider can only be responsible for those components in scope of certification (*).\n\n| ID*Identifier* | Threat

implementation of a wallet solution**\n\nA conformity assessment activity shall consist of selecting specific evaluation activities.\n\nNational certification schemes shall specify an evaluation activity to assess the information provided, covering at least the following:\n\nThe analysis mentioned in points (a) to (b) shall rely on the rationale and justification provided by the wallet provider.\n\n- (a) an analysis of the information provided to confirm that it is suited for one of the architectures specified in national certification schemes;\n- (b) an analysis of the coverage of the cybersecurity risks and threats identified in the risk register of Annex I by the described security controls.\n\n**2.Evaluation activities related to the wallet secure cryptographic device**\n\n- (1) Critical operations, including cryptographic computations, are not required to be fully implemented in the WSCD. However, the part implemented in the WSCD, when operating as part of the wallet solution, shall guarantee the protection of the critical operations it performs against attacks by attackers with high attack potential in accordance with <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"5\" data-short=\"Regulation 2015/1502\" data-celex=\"32015R1502\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502</span>.\n- (2) The WSCD or part thereof may be within the object of certification when it is provided by the certificate holder or applicant, or outside of its scope when it is embedded in a device provided by the end user. In addition, national certification schemes shall specify the evaluation activities to verify the suitability of the WSCD, in the two following cases:\n   - (a) if the WSCA depends on the particular WSCD (i.e. if it needs to be evaluated as a composite product based on the WSCD) then the evaluation of the WSCA shall require access to additional information related to the WSCD’s certification, including, in particular, its evaluation technical report;\n   - (b) if an architecture considered in the scheme uses several WSCDs, or if some of the operations on critical assets are performed outside of the WSCD, then national certification schemes shall include evaluation activities to ensure that the overall solution offers the expected level of security.\n- (3) As a prerequisite to the certification under national certification schemes, the WSCD shall be assessed against the requirements of assurance level high as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502.\n- (4) In addition, in the documentation related to each specific architecture, national certification schemes shall formulate assumptions for this evaluation of the WSCD under which resistance against attackers with high attack potential in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 can be provided and specify the evaluation activities to confirm these assumptions and to confirm after issuance of the certificate that the assumptions are still verified. The national schemes shall also require the candidates to certification to refine these assumptions for their specific implementation, and to describe the measures in place to guarantee that the assumptions are verified throughout the certification lifecycle.\n- (5) In all cases, national certification schemes shall include an evaluation activity to verify that the assurance information available for the WSCD is suitable for the purpose of the wallet solution, through an analysis of the assurance information, such as the security target for EUCC certificates, including the following activities:\n   - (a) verifying that the scope of the evaluation is suitable, which for EUCC certificates, for instance, means verifying that the security target claims conformity to one of the protection profiles recommended in the EUCC;\n   - (b) verifying that the assumptions on the operating environment are compatible with the wallet solution, which for EUCC certificates, for instance, means that these assumptions can be found in the security target;\n   - (c) verifying that the recommendations in the user guidance or documentation are compatible with the conditions on which the WSCD is to be used in the wallet solution;\n   - (d) verifying that the assumptions made in the national certification scheme about WSCDs are verified and covered in the assurance information.\n- (6) In cases where some of the verifications are not fully conclusive, national certification schemes shall require certification bodies to specify compensating requirements for the wallet secure cryptographic application (WSCA) based on the WSCD, to be included in the evaluation of the WSCA. If this is not possible, national certification schemes shall deem the WSCD unsuitable, meaning that the wallet solution shall not be issued a certificate of conformity.\n\n**3.Evaluation activities related to the wallet secure cryptographic application (WSCA)**\n\n- (1) National certification schemes shall require that a WSCA, as part of a wallet solution, is evaluated against the requirements of at least assurance level high as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502.\n- (2) This evaluation shall include a vulnerability assessment, as set out in EN ISO/IEC 15408-3:2022 at level AVA_VAN.5, as set out in Annex I of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/482, unless it is duly justified to the certification body that the security characteristics of the WSCA make it possible to use a lower assessment level while keeping the same overall assurance level high as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502.\n- (3) When the WSCA is not provided by the wallet provider, national certification schemes shall formulate assumptions for this evaluation of the WSCA under which resistance against attackers with high attack potential in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 can be provided and specify the evaluation activities to confirm these assumptions and to confirm after issuance of the certificate that the assumptions are still verified. The national schemes shall also require the candidates to certification to refine these assumptions for their specific implementation, and to describe the measures in place to guarantee that the assumptions are verified throughout the certification lifecycle.\n- (4) In all cases, national certification schemes shall include an evaluation activity to verify that the assurance information available for the WSCA is suitable for the purpose of the wallet solution, through an analysis of the assurance information, such as the security target for EUCC certificates, including the following activities:\n   - (a) verifying that the scope of the evaluation is suitable, which for EUCC certificates, for instance, means verifying that the security target claims conformity to one of the protection profiles recommended in the EUCC;\n   - (b) verifying that the assumptions on the operating environment are compatible with the wallet solution, which for EUCC certificates, for instance, means that these assumptions can be found in the security target;\n   - (c) verifying that the recommendations in the user guidance or documentation are compatible with the conditions on which the WSCA is to be used in the wallet solution;\n   - (d) verifying that the assumptions made in the national certification scheme about WSCAs are verified and covered in the assurance information.\n- (5) National certification schemes shall require that the evaluation of the WSCA covers all security controls implemented by this WSCA.\n\n**4.Evaluation activities related to the end user device**\n\nSince the risk register, as set out in Annex I of this Regulation, identifies risks that are directly linked to the security of the end user device, national certification schemes shall specify security requirements for end user devices. However, as these devices are provided by the end user and not by the wallet provider, these requirements shall be covered by assumptions.\n\nFor each assumption, the wallet solution shall include a mechanism to verify for every wallet unit that the underlying end user device satisfies the assumption. Such mechanisms shall be considered as security controls and covered by evaluation activities to demonstrate both their suitability and their effectiveness at the appropriate assurance level.\n\nTwo examples are set out below:\n\n- (a) an end user device may include a certified WSCD, which needs to be demonstrated. Typically, this would be done by using a cryptographic mechanism to verify the presence in the certified WSCD of a cryptographic secret that is only available in the certified WSCD. In this case, this cryptographic secret should be considered as a critical asset and be covered by the certification of the WSCD and/or of the WSCA;\n- (b) a typical requirement for end user devices would be that the devices must receive security updates. Since this requirement is related to the wallet instance, the mechanism used to verify the availability of security updates only needs to be covered by evaluation activities at an assurance level suitable for the wallet instance, especially as it is likely to be integrated into the wallet instance.\n\n**5.Evaluation activities related to the wallet instance**\n\n- (1) The evaluation of the wallet instance shall consider the following two main challenges:\n   - (a) the wallet instance is likely to exist in a set of variants of the same base application, with each variant specialised for a specific category of end user devices;\n   - (b) the different variants of the wallet instance will likely need frequent updates in order to follow the development of the underlying security platform, for instance when vulnerabilities are identified that require changes to applications.\n- (2) The evaluation of the wallet instance shall take into consideration these specific challenges. One of the immediate consequences is that the Common Criteria framework may not be suitable in all cases. Therefore, alternative evaluation methodologies shall be considered where necessary. National certification schemes shall consider the use of the EN 17640:2018 methodology for the following:\n   - (a) as part of the scheme itself;\n   - (b) through national schemes based on the methodology;\n   - (c) through national schemes based on similar principles but created before the development of the EN 17640:2018 methodology.\n- (3) In addition, as there may be limited added value in performing a full dedicated evaluation of each variant, national certification schemes shall consider specifying criteria allowing sampling to be performed, in order to avoid repetition of identical evaluation activities and to focus on activities that are specific to a given variant. National certification schemes shall require all certification bodies to justify their use of sampling.\n- (4) National certification schemes shall include updates of the wallet instance in the overall change management process specified for the wallet solution. They shall also lay down rules on the procedures that shall be performed by the wallet provider for every update (e.g. analysing the impact of the changes on the security controls), and on the evaluation activities that shall be performed by the certification body on updates under specified conditions (e.g. assessing the operating effectiveness of a modified security control). The change management process is one of the processes whose operating effectiveness is required to be checked annually in accordance with Article 18(3).\n\n**6.Evaluation activities related to the services and processes used for the provision and operation of the wallet solution**\n\n- (1) For the evaluation of services and processes that play a role in the provision and operation of the wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided, the evaluation team shall gather evidence by conducting evaluation activities that may include audit, inspection, verification and validation activities.\n- (2) The certification body shall confirm the sufficiency and appropriateness of the evidence to provide sufficient assurance that the services and processes meet the certification requirements, by confirming the following:\n   - (a) the accuracy of the information presented in the description of the processes and services;\n   - (b) the suitability of the design and the controls of the processes and services to meet the evaluation criteria;\n   - (c) the operating effectiveness of an implementation of these controls throughout a specified period before the evaluation.\n- (3) The accuracy of the description and the operating effectiveness of an implementation of controls may be considered as verification objectives, in the sense of ISO/IEC 17000:2020, of the corresponding claims by the wallet provider (i.e. confirmation of fairness of events that have already occurred or results that have already been obtained), whereas the suitability of the design and the controls of the services and processes to meet the evaluation criteria may be considered as a validation objective, in the sense of ISO/IEC 17000:2020, of the corresponding claim by the wallet provider (i.e. confirmation of plausibility regarding an intended future use or projected outcome).\n- (4) Considering that a wallet solution is not allowed to operate before being certified, operating effectiveness cannot be confirmed on the basis of the actual operation of the solution. Therefore, this shall be confirmed using evidence gathered during tests or pilots.\n- (5) National certification schemes may already exist for specific services and processes, for instance for the onboarding of users. The use of such schemes shall be considered by national certification schemes, if applicable.\n\n**7.Evaluation activities related to the ICT services used for the provision and operation of the wallet solution**\n\n- (1) Some wallet architectures may rely on dedicated ICT services, including cloud services for the provision and operation of a wallet solution, and these services may host sensitive data as well as sensitive operations. In such a case, national certification schemes shall specify security requirements for these ICT services.\n- (2) Many certification schemes already exist for ICT services, cloud services, and other sources of assurance information, including those listed in Annex II. National certification schemes shall rely, when available and applicable, on those existing mechanisms, through one of the following mechanisms:\n   - (a) mandating the use of a specific scheme or of a selection of schemes, by specifying the conditions under which the ICT or cloud services is to be assessed using these schemes;\n   - (b) leaving the choice of the assessment to the wallet provider and use the dependency analysis activity to analyse the suitability of the assurance information obtained through these assessments.\n- (3) In both cases, national certification schemes shall specify additional evaluation activities as needed to analyse or supplement the information obtained through these schemes.\n\n\n## ANNEX V\n\n1. The information that shall be made public pursuant to Article 8(5) shall include at least the following:\n\n- (a) any limitations on the use of a wallet solution;\n- (b) guidance and recommendations by the wallet provider to assist end users with the secure configuration, installation, deployment, operation and maintenance of wallets;\n- (c) the period during which security support will be offered to end users, in particular as regards to the availability of cybersecurity related updates;\n- (d) contact information of the manufacturer or provider and accepted methods for receiving vulnerability information from end users and security researchers;\n- (e) a reference to online repositories listing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to wallets and to any relevant cybersecurity advisories.\n\n2. The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made available in a clear, comprehensive and easily accessible manner, in a publicly accessible space, to any person seeking to use a wallet solution.\n\n\n## ANNEX VI\n\n**1.Assessing the availability of assurance documentation**\n\nEvaluators shall list the assurance documentation available for every relevant component of the wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided. Then, evaluators shall assess the overall relevance of each piece of assurance documentation for the dependency review.\n\nThe following aspects shall be considered in the analysis:\n\n- (1) about the assurance documentation itself:\n   - (a) the type of assurance documentation, with all required details,\n   - (b) the period covered or period of validity,\n   - (c) the applicable framework (e.g. existing standard);\n   - (d) whether the assurance documentation includes a mapping to the scheme’s requirements;\n- (2) about the assurance report issuer’s professional competence and impartiality:\n   - (a) name of the certification body and, if available, name of the lead evaluator;\n   - (b) evidence of the certification body’s and the evaluator’s competence (e.g. accreditation, personal certification, etc.);\n   - (c) evidence of the certification body’s and the evaluator’s impartiality (e.g. accreditation, etc.).\n\n**2.Assessing assurance related to individual requirements**\n\nEvaluators shall verify that the assurance documentation available for the wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided is adequate to determine that the wallet solution meets the expectations relative to the certification scheme’s individual requirements.\n\nThis assessment shall be performed for every relevant component of the wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided, by formulating an assumption on the wallet solution’s security controls.\n\nFor each such assumption, the evaluation team shall determine whether or not the assurance provided in the available assurance documentation is adequate.\n\nThe determination that the assurance is adequate shall be based on the following:\n\n- (1) the required information is available, with the expected assurance level, in the assurance documentation;\n- (2) the information available in the assurance documentation does not cover the full scope of the requirement, but additional controls or compensating controls (i.e., internal controls that reduce the risk of existing or potential control weakness) implemented in the wallet solution or in the electronic identification scheme under which they are provided allow the evaluators to determine that the information is adequate;\n- (3) the information available in the assurance documentation does not offer the expected assurance level but the controls implemented to assess and monitor the wallet provider allow the evaluators to determine that the information is adequate;\n- (4) if the assurance documentation mentions nonconformities on the design or implementation of the controls used to meet an assumption, the remedial actions proposed and implemented by the wallet provider and reviewed by its evaluators shall be adequate to guarantee that the assumption is indeed met.\n\n\n## ANNEX VII\n\n1.
