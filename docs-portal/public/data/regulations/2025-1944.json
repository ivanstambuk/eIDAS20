They aim at providing certainty in identifying the addressee and ensure a high level of confidence in the identification of the sender.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 44(1a) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> should only apply where qualified trust services for the provision of qualified electronic registered delivery services comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex I to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust service provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>.\n\n- (4) Pursuant to Article 44(2a) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>, where qualified trust service providers agree to make their services interoperable, it is important that they adhere to appropriate standards and specifications laid down in Annex II to this Implementing Regulation in order to easily transfer electronic registered data between two or more qualified trust service providers and to promote fair practices in the internal market.\n\n- (5) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications.
