They aim at providing certainty in identifying the addressee and ensure a high level of confidence in the identification of the sender.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 44(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified trust services for the provision of qualified electronic registered delivery services comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex I to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust service provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (4) Pursuant to Article 44(2a) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, where qualified trust service providers agree to make their services interoperable, it is important that they adhere to appropriate standards and specifications laid down in Annex II to this Implementing Regulation in order to easily transfer electronic registered data between two or more qualified trust service providers and to promote fair practices in the internal market.\n\n- (5) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\\], the Commission should review and update this Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (6) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\\], and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\\] apply to all personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (7) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\\] and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.\n\n- (8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Reference standards and specifications for qualified electronic registered delivery services**\n\nThe reference standards and specifications referred to in Article 44(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 are set out in the Annex I to this Regulation.\n\n### Article 2\n**Reference standards and specifications for the interoperability between qualified electronic registered delivery services**\n\nThe reference standards and specifications referred to in Article 44(2b) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 are set out in the Annex II to this Regulation.\n\n### Article 3\n**Entry into force**\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\n---\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 September 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\n\n# ANNEX I\n\n## ANNEX I\n\n- 1.
