Those qualified trust services play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalent ones.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 33(2) and Article (40) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> should only apply where qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals comply with the technical standards set out in this Regulation. Those standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust services, as well as the ability to verify the qualified status and technical validity of qualified electronic signatures and qualified electronic seals.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"12\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>.\n\n- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications.
