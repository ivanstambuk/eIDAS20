Those qualified trust services play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalent ones.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 33(2) and Article (40) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals comply with the technical standards set out in this Regulation. Those standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust services, as well as the ability to verify the qualified status and technical validity of qualified electronic signatures and qualified electronic seals.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulations/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span>, the Commission should review and update this Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (5) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (6) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span> and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.\n\n- (7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Reference standards and specifications**\n\nThe reference standards and specifications referred to in Article 33(2) and Article 40 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n\n### Article 2\n**Entry into force**\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\n---\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 September 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\n\n# ANNEX\n\n## ANNEX\n\n****List of reference standards and specifications for qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals****\n\n- 1.
