Peer reviews should enable Member States to understand the electronic identification schemes to be notified in accordance with Article 9(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and effectively cooperate with a view to ensuring interoperability of those schemes and building trust across the Union. Peer reviews should be organised in such a way as to ensure equitable distribution of efforts and broad representation of all Member States and should not be understood as audits.\n\n(2) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 [Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 of 24 February 2015 establishing procedural arrangements for cooperation between Member States on electronic identification pursuant to Article 12(7) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 53, 25.2.2015, p. 14, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/296/oj).] established the procedural arrangements for cooperation on electronic identification schemes within the context of the former eIDAS Cooperation Network, including for peer reviews conducted by members of that network. Since the peer review tasks are now to be organised by the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Commission Decision C(2024)6132 of 5.9.2024 establishing the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group and amending Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296, following Article 46e(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 ('Cooperation Group'), Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 should be repealed.\n\n(3) To make peer reviews easily accessible, any Member State should be able to request the initiation of a peer review. The request should indicate the reasons for requesting the peer review and contain sufficient information to corroborate that the peer review may contribute to the interoperability or security of electronic identification schemes to be notified. To this end, creating uniform rules for the minimum required information is necessary to ensure that the peer review can be completed in an efficient and timely manner. The Commission may organise meetings of the Cooperation Group to facilitate the timely initiation and conclusion of a peer review.\n\n(4) Where a Member State provides information to the other Member States on an electronic identification scheme in accordance with Article 7, point (g) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 ('pre-notification'), that action should formally be considered as a request by the notifying Member State to perform a peer review of its electronic identification scheme.\n\n(5) To ensure effective preparation and execution of the peer review, standardised roles and responsibilities in the peer review should be identified. Member States should have the possibility to appoint representatives to fulfil those roles and responsibilities. As it is critical to ensure that all peer reviews run smoothly and are conducted in a streamlined and expeditious manner, the practicalities of each peer review, indicatively its exact scope and timing, should be agreed among the Member States involved in that peer review.\n\n(6) To ensure that all Member States contribute to the implementation of the peer review mechanism, as well as to enable them to benefit from peer learning, representatives of each Member State should contribute to an equitable distribution of efforts among Member States across all peer reviews to be conducted.\n\n(7) To foster a high level of trust in peer reviewed electronic identification schemes, Member States should provide the minimum required information, while ensuring the confidentiality of potentially sensitive information. Such information should be evaluated by three working groups in the peer reviews, each with a mandate corresponding to the central topics for evaluating an electronic identification scheme as set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501 [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501 of 8 September 2015 on the interoperability framework pursuant to Article 12(8) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1501/oj).] and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 of 8 September 2015 on setting out minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance levels for electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 7, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj).].\n\n(8) As Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 already established English as the language of cooperation, unless otherwise agreed, it is existing practice of Member States to undertake the peer review process in English. Therefore, Member States should provide relevant information for the peer review at least in English. However, translation should not cause unreasonable administrative or financial burdens. In this respect, Member States are free to use automated translation tools, including the ones provided by the Commission.\n\n(9) Taking into account the importance of peer reviews as a tool to ensure the trustworthiness of notified electronic identification schemes, a streamlined process should be established for the adoption of a clear and comprehensive final peer review report. During that process, the Cooperation Group and the Member States participating in the peer review should have the possibility to put additional questions to the Member State whose electronic identification scheme is being peer reviewed, while that Member State should have the opportunity to provide additional observations. To ensure transparency, the process should be completed with the publication of the Cooperation Group’s opinion on the conclusion of the peer review.\n\n(10) Since electronic identification schemes may undergo changes after conclusion of their peer review, it is also necessary to set up a process for initiating an update of prior peer reviews if such changes can impact the interoperability, security or trustworthiness of the notified electronic identification scheme. This would enable the peer reviews to remain relevant over time as electronic identification schemes evolve.\n\n(11) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).], and, where relevant, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).], Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n(12) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered its opinion on 28 May 2025.\n\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**General principles for the peer review**\n\n1. Where a Member State makes a pre-notification of an electronic identification scheme to the Commission and to the other Member States, the peer review shall be initiated in accordance with Article 2.\n\n2. The Member State that makes a pre-notification of an electronic identification scheme may, at any point, withdraw its pre-notification. Where the Member State withdraws their pre-notification of the electronic identification scheme, the peer review shall be considered as terminated.\n\n3. Any Member State may decide to participate in the peer review of the electronic identification scheme of another Member State.\n\n4. Each Member State involved in a peer review shall bear the costs it incurs in the process.\n\n5. Representatives of the Member States that conduct the peer review shall use the information obtained through the peer review solely for the purposes of that review and shall not disclose any sensitive or confidential information obtained during the peer review to third parties.\n\n6. A Member State that decides to participate in the peer review of an electronic identification scheme of another Member State shall disclose any conflict of interest in relation to representatives appointed by that Member State. Where there is a conflict of interest, the Member State whose electronic identification scheme is being peer-reviewed may refuse the participation of the relevant representative in the assessment of its electronic identification scheme.\n\n7. Any disputes arising during the peer review in relation to the peer review activities as laid down in Article 4(4) of this Regulation shall be settled in accordance with the Cooperation Group’s rules of procedure.\n\n8. An electronic identification scheme shall not be subject to further peer review within two years from the conclusion of a peer review, except where significant changes set out in Article 6(1) were made to the peer-reviewed electronic identification scheme.\n\n### Article 2\n**Initiation of the peer review**\n\n1. The pre-notification shall include at least:\n\n(a) a comparison between the pre-notified electronic identification scheme and requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502, under the form of a level of assurance mapping document for the peer review in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation;\n(b) a high-level description of the electronic identification scheme, of its ecosystem and of electronic identification in the Member State having made the pre-notification, under the form of a whitepaper in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation;\n(c) information regarding interoperability of the electronic identification scheme and the requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501, under the form of an interoperability framework mapping document in accordance with the template set out in Annex III to this Regulation.\n\n2. The Commission shall disseminate the pre-notification information to the Cooperation Group.\n\n3. The information required under paragraph 1, point (c), shall be provided at least in English. Member States shall not be obliged to translate any document where this would create an unreasonable administrative or financial burden.\n\n### Article 3\n**Preparation of the peer review**\n\n1. Upon confirmation of receipt of a complete pre-notification, the Commission shall inform the Cooperation Group of the initiation of the peer review and schedule a meeting where the pre-notified electronic identification scheme is put on the meeting agenda for presentation to the Cooperation Group by the Member State having made the pre-notification.\n\n2. The chair of the Cooperation Group shall ensure that the scheduled meeting referred to in paragraph 1 takes place no later than two months after the Cooperation Group is informed of the initiation of the peer review.\n\n3. The date of the presentation shall be considered the official start date of the peer review.\n\n4. After the Member State having made the pre-notification has given the presentation referred to in paragraph 3, the other Member States may appoint representatives to participate in the peer review on their behalf. If they do so, they shall provide the names and contact details of their representatives. Those appointed representatives shall form the peer review group.\n\nThe members of the peer review group shall agree on assigning the following roles:\n\n(a) one coordinator who shall be responsible for organising the peer review and managing communication with Member States, the Cooperation Group and the Commission;\n(b) up to three rapporteurs depending on the scope of the peer review and each one of them to lead a working group as referred to in Article 4(2);\n(c) at least one active member per working group, who shall assist in generating questions and providing feedback to the rapporteurs and contribute to drafting the final peer review report.\n\n5. The coordinator referred to in paragraph 4, point (a), shall oversee proper execution of the peer review and monitor compliance with the procedural requirements set out in this Regulation. To that end, the coordinator shall carry out the following tasks in a timely manner:\n\n(a) organisation of the questions and answers;\n(b) finalisation of the peer review report;\n(c) drafting of the opinion on the peer reviewed electronic identification scheme.\n\n6. The rapporteurs referred to in paragraph 4, point (b), shall identify questions for the Member State having made the pre-notification and draft the elements of the peer review report that relate to the area of responsibility of their respective working group.\n\n7. Taking into account the guidance provided by the Cooperation Group, the Member State having made the pre-notification and the Member States involved in the peer review shall agree on any organisational arrangements relating to the peer review not specifically provided for in this Regulation, including rules and guidelines regarding confidentiality and conflicts of interest.\n\n8. The duration of the peer review shall not exceed three months from the official start date of the peer review referred to in paragraph 3 and may be extended by a maximum of two months where all Member States involved in the peer review agree to do so.\n\n### Article 4\n**Organisation of the peer review**\n\n1. The peer review group shall conduct the peer review based on the information provided in accordance with Article 2(1) by the Member State having made the pre-notification.\n\n2. The peer review shall be organised in three working groups, or using any other process agreed in the Cooperation Group in accordance with its Rules of Procedure. Where working groups are used, each working group shall be composed of one rapporteur and at least one active member.\n\n3. The working groups referred to in paragraph 2 shall be the following:\n\n(a) an enrolment working group, peer-reviewing the alignment of the pre-notified electronic identification scheme with the requirements in relation to enrolment as set out in section 2.1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502;\n(b) an electronic identification means management and authentication working group, peer-reviewing the alignment of the pre-notified electronic identification scheme with the requirements in relation to electronic identification means management and authentication as set out in sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502;\n(c) a management and organisation working group peer-reviewing the alignment of the pre-notified electronic identification scheme with the requirements in relation to management and organisation as set out in section 2.4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502.\n\n4. The peer review shall include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following activities:\n\n(a) assessment of relevant documentation provided by the Member State having made the pre-notification;\n(b) examination of processes described as part of that documentation;\n(c) technical seminars;\n(d) consideration of independent third-party assessments, where relevant assessments of this kind are available;\n(e) drafting of the peer review report that summarises the peer review’s findings and results.\n\n5. The working groups may make duly justified requests for additional information, supported by additional documentation, from the Member State having made the pre-notification where the information provided in accordance with Article 2(1) is not sufficient, for the termination of the peer review.\n\n6. The Member State having made the pre-notification shall comply with such requests except where one of the following applies:\n\n(a) it does not possess the information or documentation and obtaining it would generate an unreasonable administrative burden;\n(b) the information or documentation requested concerns matters of public security or national security;\n(c) the information concerns business matters, professional or company secrets;\n(d) the sensitivity of the information makes it impossible to establish a secure channel to communicate the information to the members of the peer review group.\n\n7. In such cases, the Member State having made the pre-notification shall inform the coordinator of the reasons for refusing to provide the requested information or documentation and shall provide a high-level summary of the information or a redacted version of the documentation.\n\n### Article 5\n**Outcome of the peer review**\n\n1. Without prejudice to Article 3(9), the peer review group shall:\n\n(a) provide a draft peer review report to the Member State having made the pre-notification no later than three months after the start date of the peer review referred to in Article 3(3) unless the peer review is subject to an extension in accordance with Article 3(8) where the report is due according to the agreed extension;\n(b) provide the draft final peer review report to the Commission and the Cooperation Group after taking into consideration any observations from the Member State having made the pre-notification on the content of the draft peer review report, and no later than three months and two weeks after the official start date of the peer review pursuant to Article 3(3) unless the peer review is subject to an extension in accordance with Article 3(8) where the report is due according to the agreed extension;\n(c) provide the Member State having made the pre-notification with a draft opinion on the pre-notified electronic identification scheme no later than three months and two weeks after the official start date of the peer review referred to in Article 3(3) unless the peer review is subject to an extension in accordance with Article 3(8) where the opinion is due according to the agreed extension and shall prepare the draft opinion using the template set out in Annex IV;\n(d) provide the Commission and the Cooperation Group with a draft final opinion on the pre-notified electronic identification scheme no later than three months and three weeks after the start date of the peer review referred to in Article 3 (3) unless the peer review is subject to an extension in accordance with Article 3(8) where the opinion is due according to the agreed extension.\n\n2. Before the Cooperation Group adopts and publishes, on a dedicated website of the Commission, its final opinion on the conclusion of the peer review in accordance with paragraph 9, it may require additional information or clarification from the Member State having made the pre-notification or from the peer review group.\n\n3. The Member State having made the pre-notification shall provide the required additional information referred to in paragraph 2, except where one of the following applies:\n\n(a) the Member State does not possess the information and obtaining it would cause an unreasonable administrative burden;\n(b) the information concerns matters of public or national security;\n(c) the information concerns matters of business, professional or company secrets;\n(d) the sensitivity of the information makes it impossible to establish a secure channel to communicate the information to the Cooperation Group.\n\n4. The final peer review report shall list the information that was requested by the peer review group or by the Cooperation Group but could not be provided on one or more grounds set out in paragraph 3, without specifying the reasons provided by the Member State having made the pre-notification. The impact of any unavailability of information may be examined by the peer review group in the final peer review report.\n\n5. The peer review group shall present the final peer review report and its draft final opinion to the Cooperation Group no later than four months, or in the case of prolongation in accordance with Article 3(8) no later than six months after the official start date of the peer review pursuant to Article 3(3).\n\n6. The final opinion of the peer review group on the electronic identification scheme of the Member State having made the pre-notification shall list any commitments made by that Member State.\n\n7. After the presentation of the final peer review report and the final opinion of the peer review group, the Cooperation Group shall adopt and publish its own opinion on the conclusion of the peer review, indicating if and how the peer-reviewed electronic identification scheme meets the requirements set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 that apply to the assurance levels indicated by the Member State having made the pre-notification, in accordance with Annex I of this Regulation. The adoption process shall follow the rules of procedure of the Cooperation Group.\n\n8. The opinion of the Cooperation Group shall identify the Member State having made the pre-notification as well as the pre-notified electronic identification scheme and its assurance level. The opinion shall also state whether the peer review was completed successfully.\n\n9. Information provided in accordance with Article 2(1) shall be published by the Cooperation Group, except where the Member State that provided the information has indicated in writing that such information should not be made public.\n\n### Article 6\n**Significant changes in peer-reviewed electronic identification schemes**\n\n1. Where a notified electronic identification scheme changes in a manner that is likely to impact its interoperability, security or trustworthiness, the Member State having made the notification shall without undue delay notify the Cooperation Group of those changes and update the information previously provided.\n\n2. Following the receipt of a notification referred to in paragraph 1, and provided the notified electronic identification scheme has been peer-reviewed, any Member State of the Cooperation Group may request an update to the peer review.\n\n3. In case of a request for an update, the procedures set out in Articles 3 to 5 shall apply accordingly and the peer review group shall limit the peer review to the elements that have been changed pursuant to the original notification and to the impacts of those changes.\n\n### Article 7\n**Repeal**\n\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 is hereby repealed.\n\n### Article 8\n**Entry into force**\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\n---\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 July 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n",

Therefore, Member States should provide relevant information for the peer review at least in English. However, translation should not cause unreasonable administrative or financial burdens. In this respect, Member States are free to use automated translation tools, including the ones provided by the Commission.</p>\n<p>(9) Taking into account the importance of peer reviews as a tool to ensure the trustworthiness of notified electronic identification schemes, a streamlined process should be established for the adoption of a clear and comprehensive final peer review report. During that process, the Cooperation Group and the Member States participating in the peer review should have the possibility to put additional questions to the Member State whose electronic identification scheme is being peer reviewed, while that Member State should have the opportunity to provide additional observations. To ensure transparency, the process should be completed with the publication of the Cooperation Group’s opinion on the conclusion of the peer review.</p>\n<p>(10) Since electronic identification schemes may undergo changes after conclusion of their peer review, it is also necessary to set up a process for initiating an update of prior peer reviews if such changes can impact the interoperability, security or trustworthiness of the notified electronic identification scheme. This would enable the peer reviews to remain relevant over time as electronic identification schemes evolve.</p>\n<p>(11) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: <a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj</a>).], and, where relevant, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: <a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj</a>).], Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: <a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj</a>).] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.</p>\n<p>(12) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered its opinion on 28 May 2025.</p>\n<p>(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,</p>\n<p><strong>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"enacting-terms\">Enacting Terms</h2>\n<h3 id=\"article-1\">Article 1</h3>\n<p><strong>General principles for the peer review</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Where a Member State makes a pre-notification of an electronic identification scheme to the Commission and to the other Member States, the peer review shall be initiated in accordance with Article 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Member State that makes a pre-notification of an electronic identification scheme may, at any point, withdraw its pre-notification.
