The supervisory body is to verify whether the trust service provider and the trust services provided by it comply with the requirements laid down in that Regulation. Where the supervisory body concludes that the trust service provider and the trust services provided by it comply with those requirements, the supervisory body is to grant qualified status to the trust service provider and the trust services it provides. To that end, supervisory bodies should make publicly available information about how trust service providers are to notify their intention of becoming a qualified trust service provider. To ensure that qualified trust service providers operate on equal terms in the Union, it is necessary that supervisory bodies verify the same type of information about trust service providers and in the same way.\n\n(2) Supervisory bodies should be transparent about how they process the information that trust service providers include in their notifications. The supervisory bodies should therefore draw up and make publicly available a description outlining how they verify whether the trust service provider complies with the relevant requirements.\n\n(3) The Regulation should apply from 12 months after its entry into force to ensure an adequate transitional period for Member States to be able to comply with the requirements of this Regulation by making the necessary adjustments as regards notifications to the supervisory bodies. Such adjustments may include updating national laws, organisational guidelines, and national information systems.\n\n(4) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n(5) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).] and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.\n\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Verification methodology**\n\n1.
