The supervisory body is to verify whether the trust service provider and the trust services provided by it comply with the requirements laid down in that Regulation. Where the supervisory body concludes that the trust service provider and the trust services provided by it comply with those requirements, the supervisory body is to grant qualified status to the trust service provider and the trust services it provides. To that end, supervisory bodies should make publicly available information about how trust service providers are to notify their intention of becoming a qualified trust service provider. To ensure that qualified trust service providers operate on equal terms in the Union, it is necessary that supervisory bodies verify the same type of information about trust service providers and in the same way.\n\n- (2) Supervisory bodies should be transparent about how they process the information that trust service providers include in their notifications. The supervisory bodies should therefore draw up and make publicly available a description outlining how they verify whether the trust service provider complies with the relevant requirements.\n\n- (3) The Regulation should apply from 12 months after its entry into force to ensure an adequate transitional period for Member States to be able to comply with the requirements of this Regulation by making the necessary adjustments as regards notifications to the supervisory bodies. Such adjustments may include updating national laws, organisational guidelines, and national information systems.\n\n- (4) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (5) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</span> of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span> and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.\n\n- (6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"8\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span>,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Verification methodology**\n\n1.
