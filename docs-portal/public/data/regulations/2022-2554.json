  "contentMarkdown": "## Preamble\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,*\n\n*Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),*\n\n*Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),*\n\n*Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),*\n\n*Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,*\n\nWhereas:\n\n## Recitals\n\n- (1) In the digital age, information and communication technology (ICT) supports complex systems used for everyday activities. It keeps our economies running in key sectors, including the financial sector, and enhances the functioning of the internal market. Increased digitalisation and interconnectedness also amplify ICT risk, making society as a whole, and the financial system in particular, more vulnerable to cyber threats or ICT disruptions. While the ubiquitous use of ICT systems and high digitalisation and connectivity are today core features of the activities of Union financial entities, their digital resilience has yet to be better addressed and integrated into their broader operational frameworks.\n\n- (2) The use of ICT has in the past decades gained a pivotal role in the provision of financial services, to the point where it has now acquired a critical importance in the operation of typical daily functions of all financial entities. Digitalisation now covers, for instance, payments, which have increasingly moved from cash and paper-based methods to the use of digital solutions, as well as securities clearing and settlement, electronic and algorithmic trading, lending and funding operations, peer-to-peer finance, credit rating, claim management and back-office operations. The insurance sector has also been transformed by the use of ICT, from the emergence of insurance intermediaries offering their services online operating with InsurTech, to digital insurance underwriting. Finance has not only become largely digital throughout the whole sector, but digitalisation has also deepened interconnections and dependencies within the financial sector and with third-party infrastructure and service providers.\n\n- (3) The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) reaffirmed in a 2020 report addressing systemic cyber risk how the existing high level of interconnectedness across financial entities, financial markets and financial market infrastructures, and particularly the interdependencies of their ICT systems, could constitute a systemic vulnerability because localised cyber incidents could quickly spread from any of the approximately 22 000 Union financial entities to the entire financial system, unhindered by geographical boundaries. Serious ICT breaches that occur in the financial sector do not merely affect financial entities taken in isolation. They also smooth the way for the propagation of localised vulnerabilities across the financial transmission channels and potentially trigger adverse consequences for the stability of the Union’s financial system, such as generating liquidity runs and an overall loss of confidence and trust in financial markets.\n\n- (4) In recent years, ICT risk has attracted the attention of international, Union and national policy makers, regulators and standard-setting bodies in an attempt to enhance digital resilience, set standards and coordinate regulatory or supervisory work. At international level, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, the Financial Stability Board, the Financial Stability Institute, as well as the G7 and G20 aim to provide competent authorities and market operators across various jurisdictions with tools to bolster the resilience of their financial systems. That work has also been driven by the need to duly consider ICT risk in the context of a highly interconnected global financial system and to seek more consistency of relevant best practices.\n\n- (5) Despite Union and national targeted policy and legislative initiatives, ICT risk continues to pose a challenge to the operational resilience, performance and stability of the Union financial system. The reforms that followed the 2008 financial crisis primarily strengthened the financial resilience of the Union financial sector and aimed to safeguard the competitiveness and stability of the Union from economic, prudential and market conduct perspectives. Although ICT security and digital resilience are part of operational risk, they have been less in the focus of the post-financial crisis regulatory agenda and have developed in only some areas of the Union’s financial services policy and regulatory landscape, or in only a few Member States.\n\n- (6) In its Communication of 8 March 2018 entitled ‘FinTech Action plan: For a more competitive and innovative European financial sector’, the Commission highlighted the paramount importance of making the Union financial sector more resilient, including from an operational perspective to ensure its technological safety and good functioning, its quick recovery from ICT breaches and incidents, ultimately enabling the effective and smooth provision of financial services across the whole Union, including under situations of stress, while also preserving consumer and market trust and confidence.\n\n- (7) In April 2019, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), (‘EIOPA’) established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), (‘ESMA’) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) (known collectively as ‘European Supervisory Authorities’ or ‘ESAs’) jointly issued technical advice calling for a coherent approach to ICT risk in finance and recommending to strengthen, in a proportionate way, the digital operational resilience of the financial services industry through a sector-specific initiative of the Union.\n\n- (8) The Union financial sector is regulated by a Single Rulebook and governed by a European system of financial supervision. Nonetheless, provisions tackling digital operational resilience and ICT security are not yet fully or consistently harmonised, despite digital operational resilience being vital for ensuring financial stability and market integrity in the digital age, and no less important than, for example, common prudential or market conduct standards. The Single Rulebook and system of supervision should therefore be developed to also cover digital operational resilience, by strengthening the mandates of competent authorities to enable them to supervise the management of ICT risk in the financial sector in order to protect the integrity and efficiency of the internal market, and to facilitate its orderly functioning.\n\n- (9) Legislative disparities and uneven national regulatory or supervisory approaches with regard to ICT risk trigger obstacles to the functioning of the internal market in financial services, impeding the smooth exercise of the freedom of establishment and the provision of services for financial entities operating on a cross-border basis. Competition between the same type of financial entities operating in different Member States could also be distorted. This is the case, in particular, for areas where Union harmonisation has been very limited, such as digital operational resilience testing, or absent, such as the monitoring of ICT third-party risk. Disparities stemming from developments envisaged at national level could generate further obstacles to the functioning of the internal market to the detriment of market participants and financial stability.\n\n- (10) To date, due to the ICT risk related provisions being only partially addressed at Union level, there are gaps or overlaps in important areas, such as ICT-related incident reporting and digital operational resilience testing, and inconsistencies as a result of emerging divergent national rules or cost-ineffective application of overlapping rules. This is particularly detrimental for an ICT-intensive user such as the financial sector since technology risks have no borders and the financial sector deploys its services on a wide cross-border basis within and outside the Union. Individual financial entities operating on a cross-border basis or holding several authorisations (e.g. one financial entity can have a banking, an investment firm, and a payment institution licence, each issued by a different competent authority in one or several Member States) face operational challenges in addressing ICT risk and mitigating adverse impacts of ICT incidents on their own and in a coherent cost-effective way.\n\n- (11) As the Single Rulebook has not been accompanied by a comprehensive ICT or operational risk framework, further harmonisation of key digital operational resilience requirements for all financial entities is required. The development of ICT capabilities and overall resilience by financial entities, based on those key requirements, with a view to withstanding operational outages, would help preserve the stability and integrity of the Union financial markets and thus contribute to ensuring a high level of protection of investors and consumers in the Union. Since this Regulation aims to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, it should be based on the provisions of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice).\n\n- (12) This Regulation aims to consolidate and upgrade ICT risk requirements as part of the operational risk requirements that have, up to this point, been addressed separately in various Union legal acts. While those acts covered the main categories of financial risk (e.g. credit risk, market risk, counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk, market conduct risk), they did not comprehensively tackle, at the time of their adoption, all components of operational resilience. The operational risk rules, when further developed in those Union legal acts, often favoured a traditional quantitative approach to addressing risk (namely setting a capital requirement to cover ICT risk) rather than targeted qualitative rules for the protection, detection, containment, recovery and repair capabilities against ICT-related incidents, or for reporting and digital testing capabilities. Those acts were primarily meant to cover and update essential rules on prudential supervision, market integrity or conduct. By consolidating and upgrading the different rules on ICT risk, all provisions addressing digital risk in the financial sector should for the first time be brought together in a consistent manner in one single legislative act. Therefore, this Regulation fills in the gaps or remedies inconsistencies in some of the prior legal acts, including in relation to the terminology used therein, and explicitly refers to ICT risk via targeted rules on ICT risk-management capabilities, incident reporting, operational resilience testing and ICT third-party risk monitoring. This Regulation should thus also raise awareness of ICT risk and acknowledge that ICT incidents and a lack of operational resilience have the possibility to jeopardise the soundness of financial entities.\n\n- (13) Financial entities should follow the same approach and the same principle-based rules when addressing ICT risk taking into account their size and overall risk profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their services, activities and operations. Consistency contributes to enhancing confidence in the financial system and preserving its stability especially in times of high reliance on ICT systems, platforms and infrastructures, which entails increased digital risk. Observing basic cyber hygiene should also avoid imposing heavy costs on the economy by minimising the impact and costs of ICT disruptions.\n\n- (14) A Regulation helps reduce regulatory complexity, fosters supervisory convergence and increases legal certainty, and also contributes to limiting compliance costs, especially for financial entities operating across borders, and to reducing competitive distortions. Therefore, the choice of a Regulation for the establishment of a common framework for the digital operational resilience of financial entities is the most appropriate way to guarantee a homogenous and coherent application of all components of ICT risk management by the Union financial sector.\n\n- (15) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) was the first horizontal cybersecurity framework enacted at Union level, applying also to three types of financial entities, namely credit institutions, trading venues and central counterparties. However, since Directive (EU) 2016/1148 set out a mechanism of identification at national level of operators of essential services, only certain credit institutions, trading venues and central counterparties that were identified by the Member States, have been brought into its scope in practice, and hence required to comply with the ICT security and incident notification requirements laid down in it. Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) sets a uniform criterion to determine the entities falling within its scope of application (size-cap rule) while also keeping the three types of financial entities in its scope.\n\n- (16) However, as this Regulation increases the level of harmonisation of the various digital resilience components, by introducing requirements on ICT risk management and ICT-related incident reporting that are more stringent in comparison to those laid down in the current Union financial services law, this higher level constitutes an increased harmonisation also in comparison with the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Consequently, this Regulation constitutes lex specialis with regard to Directive (EU) 2022/2555. At the same time, it is crucial to maintain a strong relationship between the financial sector and the Union horizontal cybersecurity framework as currently laid out in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 to ensure consistency with the cyber security strategies adopted by Member States and to allow financial supervisors to be made aware of cyber incidents affecting other sectors covered by that Directive.\n\n- (17) In accordance with Article 4(2) of the Treaty on European Union and without prejudice to the judicial review by the Court of Justice, this Regulation should not affect the responsibility of Member States with regard to essential State functions concerning public security, defence and the safeguarding of national security, for example concerning the supply of information which would be contrary to the safeguarding of national security.\n\n- (18) To enable cross-sector learning and to effectively draw on experiences of other sectors in dealing with cyber threats, the financial entities referred to in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 should remain part of the ‘ecosystem’ of that Directive (for example, Cooperation Group and computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs)).The ESAs and national competent authorities should be able to participate in the strategic policy discussions and the technical workings of the Cooperation Group under that Directive, and to exchange information and further cooperate with the single points of contact designated or established in accordance with that Directive. The competent authorities under this Regulation should also consult and cooperate with the CSIRTs. The competent authorities should also be able to request technical advice from the competent authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and establish cooperation arrangements that aim to ensure effective and fast-response coordination mechanisms.\n\n- (19) Given the strong interlinkages between the digital resilience and the physical resilience of financial entities, a coherent approach with regard to the resilience of critical entities is necessary in this Regulation and Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and the Council (9). Given that the physical resilience of financial entities is addressed in a comprehensive manner by the ICT risk management and reporting obligations covered by this Regulation, the obligations laid down in Chapters III and IV of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 should not apply to financial entities falling within the scope of that Directive.\n\n- (20) Cloud computing service providers are one category of digital infrastructure covered by Directive (EU) 2022/2555. The Union Oversight Framework (‘Oversight Framework’) established by this Regulation applies to all critical ICT third-party service providers, including cloud computing service providers providing ICT services to financial entities, and should be considered complementary to the supervision carried out pursuant to Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Moreover, the Oversight Framework established by this Regulation should cover cloud computing service providers in the absence of a Union horizontal framework establishing a digital oversight authority.\n\n- (21) In order to maintain full control over ICT risk, financial entities need to have comprehensive capabilities to enable a strong and effective ICT risk management, as well as specific mechanisms and policies for handling all ICT-related incidents and for reporting major ICT-related incidents. Likewise, financial entities should have policies in place for the testing of ICT systems, controls and processes, as well as for managing ICT third-party risk. The digital operational resilience baseline for financial entities should be increased while also allowing for a proportionate application of requirements for certain financial entities, particularly microenterprises, as well as financial entities subject to a simplified ICT risk management framework. To facilitate an efficient supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision that is proportionate and addresses the need to reduce administrative burdens on the competent authorities, the relevant national supervisory arrangements in respect of such financial entities should take into account their size and overall risk profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their services, activities and operations even when the relevant thresholds established in Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) are exceeded. In particular, supervisory activities should focus primarily on the need to address serious risks associated with the ICT risk management of a particular entity.\n\n- (22) ICT-related incident reporting thresholds and taxonomies vary significantly at national level. While common ground may be achieved through the relevant work undertaken by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and the Cooperation Group under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, divergent approaches on setting the thresholds and use of taxonomies still exist, or can emerge, for the remainder of financial entities. Due to those divergences, there are multiple requirements that financial entities must comply with, especially when operating across several Member States and when part of a financial group. Moreover, such divergences have the potential to hinder the creation of further uniform or centralised Union mechanisms that speed up the reporting process and support a quick and smooth exchange of information between competent authorities, which is crucial for addressing ICT risk in the event of large-scale attacks with potentially systemic consequences.\n\n- (23) To reduce the administrative burden and potentially duplicative reporting obligations for certain financial entities, the requirement for the incident reporting pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) should cease to apply to payment service providers that fall within the scope of this Regulation. Consequently, credit institutions, e-money institutions, payment institutions and account information service providers, as referred to in Article 33(1) of that Directive, should, from the date of application of this Regulation, report pursuant to this Regulation, all operational or security payment-related incidents which have been previously reported pursuant to that Directive, irrespective of whether such incidents are ICT-related.\n\n- (24) To enable competent authorities to fulfil supervisory roles by acquiring a complete overview of the nature, frequency, significance and impact of ICT-related incidents and to enhance the exchange of information between relevant public authorities, including law enforcement authorities and resolution authorities, this Regulation should lay down a robust ICT-related incident reporting regime whereby the relevant requirements address current gaps in financial services law, and remove existing overlaps and duplications to alleviate costs. It is essential to harmonise the ICT-related incident reporting regime by requiring all financial entities to report to their competent authorities through a single streamlined framework as set out in this Regulation. In addition, the ESAs should be empowered to further specify relevant elements for the ICT-related incident reporting framework, such as taxonomy, timeframes, data sets, templates and applicable thresholds. To ensure full consistency with Directive (EU) 2022/2555, financial entities should be allowed, on a voluntary basis, to notify significant cyber threats to the relevant competent authority, when they consider that the cyber threat is of relevance to the financial system, service users or clients.\n\n- (25) Digital operational resilience testing requirements have been developed in certain financial subsectors setting out frameworks that are not always fully aligned. This leads to a potential duplication of costs for cross-border financial entities and makes the mutual recognition of the results of digital operational resilience testing complex which, in turn, can fragment the internal market.\n\n- (26) In addition, where no ICT testing is required, vulnerabilities remain undetected and result in exposing a financial entity to ICT risk and ultimately create a higher risk to the stability and integrity of the financial sector. Without Union intervention, digital operational resilience testing would continue to be inconsistent and would lack a system of mutual recognition of ICT testing results across different jurisdictions. In addition, as it is unlikely that other financial subsectors would adopt testing schemes on a meaningful scale, they would miss out on the potential benefits of a testing framework, in terms of revealing ICT vulnerabilities and risks, and testing defence capabilities and business continuity, which contributes to increasing the trust of customers, suppliers and business partners. To remedy those overlaps, divergences and gaps, it is necessary to lay down rules for a coordinated testing regime and thereby facilitate the mutual recognition of advanced testing for financial entities meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation.\n\n- (27) Financial entities’ reliance on the use of ICT services is partly driven by their need to adapt to an emerging competitive digital global economy, to boost their business efficiency and to meet consumer demand. The nature and extent of such reliance has been continuously evolving in recent years, driving cost reduction in financial intermediation, enabling business expansion and scalability in the deployment of financial activities while offering a wide range of ICT tools to manage complex internal processes.\n\n- (28) The extensive use of ICT services is evidenced by complex contractual arrangements, whereby financial entities often encounter difficulties in negotiating contractual terms that are tailored to the prudential standards or other regulatory requirements to which they are subject, or otherwise in enforcing specific rights, such as access or audit rights, even when the latter are enshrined in their contractual arrangements. Moreover, many of those contractual arrangements do not provide for sufficient safeguards allowing for the fully-fledged monitoring of subcontracting processes, thus depriving the financial entity of its ability to assess the associated risks. In addition, as ICT third-party service providers often provide standardised services to different types of clients, such contractual arrangements do not always cater adequately for the individual or specific needs of financial industry actors.\n\n- (29) Even though Union financial services law contains certain general rules on outsourcing, monitoring of the contractual dimension is not fully anchored into Union law. In the absence of clear and bespoke Union standards applying to the contractual arrangements concluded with ICT third-party service providers, the external source of ICT risk is not comprehensively addressed. Consequently, it is necessary to set out certain key principles to guide financial entities’ management of ICT third-party risk, which are of particular importance when financial entities resort to ICT third-party service providers to support their critical or important functions. Those principles should be accompanied by a set of core contractual rights in relation to several elements in the performance and termination of contractual arrangements with a view to providing certain minimum safeguards in order to strengthen financial entities’ ability to effectively monitor all ICT risk emerging at the level of third-party service providers. Those principles are complementary to the sectoral law applicable to outsourcing.\n\n- (30) A certain lack of homogeneity and convergence regarding the monitoring of ICT third-party risk and ICT third-party dependencies is evident today. Despite efforts to address outsourcing, such as EBA Guidelines on outsourcing of 2019 and ESMA Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers of 2021 the broader issue of counteracting systemic risk which may be triggered by the financial sector’s exposure to a limited number of critical ICT third-party service providers is not sufficiently addressed by Union law. The lack of rules at Union level is compounded by the absence of national rules on mandates and tools that allow financial supervisors to acquire a good understanding of ICT third-party dependencies and to monitor adequately risks arising from the concentration of ICT third-party dependencies.\n\n- (31) Taking into account the potential systemic risk entailed by increased outsourcing practices and by the ICT third-party concentration, and mindful of the insufficiency of national mechanisms in providing financial supervisors with adequate tools to quantify, qualify and redress the consequences of ICT risk occurring at critical ICT third-party service providers, it is necessary to establish an appropriate Oversight Framework allowing for a continuous monitoring of the activities of ICT third-party service providers that are critical ICT third-party service providers to financial entities, while ensuring that the confidentiality and security of customers other than financial entities is preserved. While intra-group provision of ICT services entails specific risks and benefits, it should not be automatically considered less risky than the provision of ICT services by providers outside of a financial group and should therefore be subject to the same regulatory framework. However, when ICT services are provided from within the same financial group, financial entities might have a higher level of control over intra-group providers, which ought to be taken into account in the overall risk assessment.\n\n- (32) With ICT risk becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, good measures for the detection and prevention of ICT risk depend to a great extent on the regular sharing between financial entities of threat and vulnerability intelligence. Information sharing contributes to creating increased awareness of cyber threats. In turn, this enhances the capacity of financial entities to prevent cyber threats from becoming real ICT-related incidents and enables financial entities to more effectively contain the impact of ICT-related incidents and to recover faster. In the absence of guidance at Union level, several factors seem to have inhibited such intelligence sharing, in particular uncertainty about its compatibility with data protection, anti-trust and liability rules.\n\n- (33) In addition, doubts about the type of information that can be shared with other market participants, or with non-supervisory authorities (such as ENISA, for analytical input, or Europol, for law enforcement purposes) lead to useful information being withheld. Therefore, the extent and quality of information sharing currently remains limited and fragmented, with relevant exchanges mostly being local (by way of national initiatives) and with no consistent Union-wide information-sharing arrangements tailored to the needs of an integrated financial system. It is therefore important to strengthen those communication channels.\n\n- (34) Financial entities should be encouraged to exchange among themselves cyber threat information and intelligence, and to collectively leverage their individual knowledge and practical experience at strategic, tactical and operational levels with a view to enhancing their capabilities to adequately assess, monitor, defend against, and respond to cyber threats, by participating in information sharing arrangements. It is therefore necessary to enable the emergence at Union level of mechanisms for voluntary information-sharing arrangements which, when conducted in trusted environments, would help the community of the financial industry to prevent and collectively respond to cyber threats by quickly limiting the spread of ICT risk and impeding potential contagion throughout the financial channels. Those mechanisms should comply with the applicable competition law rules of the Union set out in the Communication from the Commission of 14 January 2011 entitled ‘Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal cooperation agreements’, as well as with Union data protection rules, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). They should operate based on the use of one or more of the legal bases that are laid down in Article 6 of that Regulation, such as in the context of the processing of personal data that is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by a third party, as referred to in Article 6(1), point (f), of that Regulation, as well as in the context of the processing of personal data necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, as referred to in Article 6(1), points (c) and (e), respectively, of that Regulation.\n\n- (35) In order to maintain a high level of digital operational resilience for the whole financial sector, and at the same time to keep pace with technological developments, this Regulation should address risk stemming from all types of ICT services. To that end, the definition of ICT services in the context of this Regulation should be understood in a broad manner, encompassing digital and data services provided through ICT systems to one or more internal or external users on an ongoing basis. That definition should, for instance, include so called ‘over the top’ services, which fall within the category of electronic communications services. It should exclude only the limited category of traditional analogue telephone services qualifying as Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) services, landline services, Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), or fixed-line telephone services.\n\n- (36) Notwithstanding the broad coverage envisaged by this Regulation, the application of the digital operational resilience rules should take into account the significant differences between financial entities in terms of their size and overall risk profile. As a general principle, when distributing resources and capabilities for the implementation of the ICT risk management framework, financial entities should duly balance their ICT-related needs to their size and overall risk profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their services, activities and operations, while competent authorities should continue to assess and review the approach of such distribution.\n\n- (37) Account information service providers, referred to in Article 33(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, are explicitly included in the scope of this Regulation, taking into account the specific nature of their activities and the risks arising therefrom. In addition, electronic money institutions and payment institutions exempted pursuant to Article 9(1) of Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and Article 32(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 are included in the scope of this Regulation even if they have not been granted authorisation in accordance Directive 2009/110/EC to issue electronic money, or if they have not been granted authorisation in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/2366 to provide and execute payment services. However, post office giro institutions, referred to in Article 2(5), point (3), of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), are excluded from the scope of this Regulation. The competent authority for payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC and account information service providers as referred to in Article 33(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, should be the competent authority designated in accordance with Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366.\n\n- (38) As larger financial entities might enjoy wider resources and can swiftly deploy funds to develop governance structures and set up various corporate strategies, only financial entities that are not microenterprises in the sense of this Regulation should be required to establish more complex governance arrangements. Such entities are better equipped in particular to set up dedicated management functions for supervising arrangements with ICT third-party service providers or for dealing with crisis management, to organise their ICT risk management according to the three lines of defence model, or to set up an internal risk management and control model, and to submit their ICT risk management framework to internal audits.\n\n- (39) Some financial entities benefit from exemptions or are subject to a very light regulatory framework under the relevant sector-specific Union law. Such financial entities include managers of alternative investment funds referred to in Article 3(2) of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), insurance and reinsurance undertakings referred to in Article 4 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), and institutions for occupational retirement provision which operate pension schemes which together do not have more than 15 members in total. In light of those exemptions it would not be proportionate to include such financial entities in the scope of this Regulation. In addition, this Regulation acknowledges the specificities of the insurance intermediation market structure, with the result that insurance intermediaries, reinsurance intermediaries and ancillary insurance intermediaries qualifying as microenterprises or as small or medium-sized enterprises should not be subject to this Regulation.\n\n- (40) Since the entities referred to in Article 2(5), points (4) to (23), of Directive 2013/36/EU are excluded from the scope of that Directive, Member States should consequently be able to choose to exempt from the application of this Regulation such entities located within their respective territories.\n\n- (41) Similarly, in order to align this Regulation to the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), it is also appropriate to exclude from the scope of this Regulation natural and legal persons referred in Articles 2 and 3 of that Directive which are allowed to provide investment services without having to obtain an authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU. However, Article 2 of Directive 2014/65/EU also excludes from the scope of that Directive entities which qualify as financial entities for the purposes of this Regulation such as, central securities depositories, collective investment undertakings or insurance and reinsurance undertakings. The exclusion from the scope of this Regulation of the persons and entities referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of that Directive should not encompass those central securities depositories, collective investment undertakings or insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\n- (42) Under sector-specific Union law, some financial entities are subject to lighter requirements or exemptions for reasons associated with their size or the services they provide. That category of financial entities includes small and non-interconnected investment firms, small institutions for occupational retirement provision which may be excluded from the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 under the conditions laid down in Article 5 of that Directive by the Member State concerned and operate pension schemes which together do not have more than 100 members in total, as well as institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and to preserve the spirit of sector-specific Union law, it is also appropriate to subject those financial entities to a simplified ICT risk management framework under this Regulation. The proportionate character of the ICT risk management framework covering those financial entities should not be altered by the regulatory technical standards that are to be developed by the ESAs. Moreover, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is appropriate to also subject payment institutions referred to in Article 32(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and electronic money institutions referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2009/110/EC exempted in accordance with national law transposing those Union legal acts to a simplified ICT risk management framework under this Regulation, while payment institutions and electronic money institutions which have not been exempted in accordance with their respective national law transposing sectoral Union law should comply with the general framework laid down by this Regulation.\n\n- (43) Similarly, financial entities which qualify as microenterprises or are subject to the simplified ICT risk management framework under this Regulation should not be required to establish a role to monitor their arrangements concluded with ICT third-party service providers on the use of ICT services; or to designate a member of senior management to be responsible for overseeing the related risk exposure and relevant documentation; to assign the responsibility for managing and overseeing ICT risk to a control function and ensure an appropriate level of independence of such control function in order to avoid conflicts of interest; to document and review at least once a year the ICT risk management framework; to subject to internal audit on a regular basis the ICT risk management framework; to perform in-depth assessments after major changes in their network and information system infrastructures and processes; to regularly conduct risk analyses on legacy ICT systems; to subject the implementation of the ICT Response and Recovery plans to independent internal audit reviews; to have a crisis management function, to expand the testing of business continuity and response and recovery plans to capture switchover scenarios between primary ICT infrastructure and redundant facilities; to report to competent authorities, upon their request, an estimation of aggregated annual costs and losses caused by major ICT-related incidents, to maintain redundant ICT capacities; to communicate to national competent authorities implemented changes following post ICT-related incident reviews; to monitor on a continuous basis relevant technological developments, to establish a comprehensive digital operational resilience testing programme as an integral part of the ICT risk management framework provided for in this Regulation, or to adopt and regularly review a strategy on ICT third-party risk. In addition, microenterprises should only be required to assess the need to maintain such redundant ICT capacities based on their risk profile. Microenterprises should benefit from a more flexible regime as regards digital operational resilience testing programmes. When considering the type and frequency of testing to be performed, they should properly balance the objective of maintaining a high digital operational resilience, the available resources and their overall risk profile. Microenterprises and financial entities subject to the simplified ICT risk management framework under this Regulation should be exempted from the requirement to perform advanced testing of ICT tools, systems and processes based on threat-led penetration testing (TLPT), as only financial entities meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation should be required to carry out such testing. In light of their limited capabilities, microenterprises should be able to agree with the ICT third-party service provider to delegate the financial entity’s rights of access, inspection and audit to an independent third-party, to be appointed by the ICT third-party service provider, provided that the financial entity is able to request, at any time, all relevant information and assurance on the ICT third-party service provider’s performance from the respective independent third-party.\n\n- (44) As only those financial entities identified for the purposes of the advanced digital resilience testing should be required to conduct threat-led penetration tests, the administrative processes and financial costs entailed in the performance of such tests should be borne by a small percentage of financial entities.\n\n- (45) To ensure full alignment and overall consistency between financial entities’ business strategies, on the one hand, and the conduct of ICT risk management, on the other hand, the financial entities’ management bodies should be required to maintain a pivotal and active role in steering and adapting the ICT risk management framework and the overall digital operational resilience strategy. The approach to be taken by management bodies should not only focus on the means of ensuring the resilience of the ICT systems, but should also cover people and processes through a set of policies which cultivate, at each corporate layer, and for all staff, a strong sense of awareness about cyber risks and a commitment to observe a strict cyber hygiene at all levels. The ultimate responsibility of the management body in managing a financial entity’s ICT risk should be an overarching principle of that comprehensive approach, further translated into the continuous engagement of the management body in the control of the monitoring of the ICT risk management.\n\n- (46) Moreover, the principle of the management body’s full and ultimate responsibility for the management of the ICT risk of the financial entity goes hand in hand with the need to secure a level of ICT-related investments and an overall budget for the financial entity that would enable the financial entity to achieve a high level of digital operational resilience.\n\n- (47) Inspired by relevant international, national and industry best practices, guidelines, recommendations and approaches to the management of cyber risk, this Regulation promotes a set of principles that facilitate the overall structure of ICT risk management. Consequently, as long as the main capabilities which financial entities put in place address the various functions in the ICT risk management (identification, protection and prevention, detection, response and recovery, learning and evolving and communication) set out in this Regulation, financial entities should remain free to use ICT risk management models that are differently framed or categorised.\n\n- (48) To keep pace with an evolving cyber threat landscape, financial entities should maintain updated ICT systems that are reliable and capable, not only for guaranteeing the processing of data required for their services, but also for ensuring sufficient technological resilience to allow them to deal adequately with additional processing needs due to stressed market conditions or other adverse situations.\n\n- (49) Efficient business continuity and recovery plans are necessary to allow financial entities to promptly and quickly resolve ICT-related incidents, in particular cyber-attacks, by limiting damage and giving priority to the resumption of activities and recovery actions in accordance with their back-up policies. However, such resumption should in no way jeopardise the integrity and security of the network and information systems or the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data.\n\n- (50) While this Regulation allows financial entities to determine their recovery time and recovery point objectives in a flexible manner and hence to set such objectives by fully taking into account the nature and the criticality of the relevant functions and any specific business needs, it should nevertheless require them to carry out an assessment of the potential overall impact on market efficiency when determining such objectives.\n\n- (51) The propagators of cyber-attacks tend to pursue financial gains directly at the source, thus exposing financial entities to significant consequences. To prevent ICT systems from losing integrity or becoming unavailable, and hence to avoid data breaches and damage to physical ICT infrastructure, the reporting of major ICT-related incidents by financial entities should be significantly improved and streamlined. ICT-related incident reporting should be harmonised through the introduction of a requirement for all financial entities to report directly to their relevant competent authorities. Where a financial entity is subject to supervision by more than one national competent authority, Member States should designate a single competent authority as the addressee of such reporting. Credit institutions classified as significant in accordance with Article 6(4) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (19) should submit such reporting to the national competent authorities, which should subsequently transmit the report to the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n- (52) The direct reporting should enable financial supervisors to have immediate access to information about major ICT-related incidents. Financial supervisors should in turn pass on details of major ICT-related incidents to public non-financial authorities (such as competent authorities and single points of contact under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, national data protection authorities, and to law enforcement authorities for major ICT-related incidents of a criminal nature) in order to enhance such authorities awareness of such incidents and, in the case of CSIRTs, to facilitate prompt assistance that may be given to financial entities, as appropriate. Member States should, in addition, be able to determine that financial entities themselves should provide such information to public authorities outside the financial services area. Those information flows should allow financial entities to swiftly benefit from any relevant technical input, advice about remedies, and subsequent follow-up from such authorities. The information on major ICT-related incidents should be mutually channelled: financial supervisors should provide all necessary feedback or guidance to the financial entity, while the ESAs should share anonymised data on cyber threats and vulnerabilities relating to an incident, to aid wider collective defence.\n\n- (53) While all financial entities should be required to carry out incident reporting, that requirement is not expected to affect all of them in the same manner. Indeed, relevant materiality thresholds, as well as reporting timelines, should be duly adjusted, in the context of delegated acts based on the regulatory technical standards to be developed by the ESAs, with a view to covering only major ICT-related incidents. In addition, the specificities of financial entities should be taken into account when setting timelines for reporting obligations.\n\n- (54) This Regulation should require credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers and electronic money institutions to report all operational or security payment-related incidents – previously reported under Directive (EU) 2015/2366 – irrespective of the ICT nature of the incident.\n\n- (55) The ESAs should be tasked with assessing the feasibility and conditions for a possible centralisation of ICT-related incident reports at Union level. Such centralisation could consist of a single EU Hub for major ICT-related incident reporting either directly receiving relevant reports and automatically notifying national competent authorities, or merely centralising relevant reports forwarded by the national competent authorities and thus fulfilling a coordination role. The ESAs should be tasked with preparing, in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, a joint report exploring the feasibility of setting up a single EU Hub.\n\n- (56) In order to achieve a high level of digital operational resilience, and in line with both the relevant international standards (e.g. the G7 Fundamental Elements for Threat-Led Penetration Testing) and with the frameworks applied in the Union, such as the TIBER-EU, financial entities should regularly test their ICT systems and staff having ICT-related responsibilities with regard to the effectiveness of their preventive, detection, response and recovery capabilities, to uncover and address potential ICT vulnerabilities. To reflect differences that exist across, and within, the various financial subsectors as regards financial entities’ level of cybersecurity preparedness, testing should include a wide variety of tools and actions, ranging from the assessment of basic requirements (e.g. vulnerability assessments and scans, open source analyses, network security assessments, gap analyses, physical security reviews, questionnaires and scanning software solutions, source code reviews where feasible, scenario-based tests, compatibility testing, performance testing or end-to-end testing) to more advanced testing by means of TLPT. Such advanced testing should be required only of financial entities that are mature enough from an ICT perspective to reasonably carry it out. The digital operational resilience testing required by this Regulation should thus be more demanding for those financial entities meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation (for example, large, systemic and ICT-mature credit institutions, stock exchanges, central securities depositories and central counterparties) than for other financial entities. At the same time, the digital operational resilience testing by means of TLPT should be more relevant for financial entities operating in core financial services subsectors and playing a systemic role (for example, payments, banking, and clearing and settlement), and less relevant for other subsectors (for example, asset managers and credit rating agencies).\n\n- (57) Financial entities involved in cross-border activities and exercising the freedoms of establishment, or of provision of services within the Union, should comply with a single set of advanced testing requirements (i.e. TLPT) in their home Member State, which should include the ICT infrastructures in all jurisdictions where the cross-border financial group operates within the Union, thus allowing such cross-border financial groups to incur related ICT testing costs in one jurisdiction only.\n\n- (58) To draw on the expertise already acquired by certain competent authorities, in particular with regard to implementing the TIBER-EU framework, this Regulation should allow Member States to designate a single public authority as responsible in the financial sector, at national level, for all TLPT matters, or competent authorities, to delegate, in the absence of such designation, the exercise of TLPT related tasks to another national financial competent authority.\n\n- (59) Since this Regulation does not require financial entities to cover all critical or important functions in one single threat-led penetration test, financial entities should be free to determine which and how many critical or important functions should be included in the scope of such a test.\n\n- (60) Pooled testing within the meaning of this Regulation – involving the participation of several financial entities in a TLPT and for which an ICT third-party service provider can directly enter into contractual arrangements with an external tester – should be allowed only where the quality or security of services delivered by the ICT third-party service provider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation, or the confidentiality of the data related to such services, are reasonably expected to be adversely impacted. Pooled testing should also be subject to safeguards (direction by one designated financial entity, calibration of the number of participating financial entities) to ensure a rigorous testing exercise for the financial entities involved which meet the objectives of the TLPT pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n- (61) In order to take advantage of internal resources available at corporate level, this Regulation should allow the use of internal testers for the purposes of carrying out TLPT, provided there is supervisory approval, no conflicts of interest, and periodical alternation of the use of internal and external testers (every three tests), while also requiring the provider of the threat intelligence in the TLPT to always be external to the financial entity. The responsibility for conducting TLPT should remain fully with the financial entity. Attestations provided by authorities should be solely for the purpose of mutual recognition and should not preclude any follow-up action needed to address the ICT risk to which the financial entity is exposed, nor should they be seen as a supervisory endorsement of a financial entity’s ICT risk management and mitigation capabilities.\n\n- (62) To ensure a sound monitoring of ICT third-party risk in the financial sector, it is necessary to lay down a set of principle-based rules to guide financial entities’ when monitoring risk arising in the context of functions outsourced to ICT third-party service providers, particularly for ICT services supporting critical or important functions, as well as more generally in the context of all ICT third-party dependencies.\n\n- (63) To address the complexity of the various sources of ICT risk, while taking into account the multitude and diversity of providers of technological solutions which enable a smooth provision of financial services, this Regulation should cover a wide range of ICT third-party service providers, including providers of cloud computing services, software, data analytics services and providers of data centre services. Similarly, since financial entities should effectively and coherently identify and manage all types of risk, including in the context of ICT services procured within a financial group, it should be clarified that undertakings which are part of a financial group and provide ICT services predominantly to their parent undertaking, or to subsidiaries or branches of their parent undertaking, as well as financial entities providing ICT services to other financial entities, should also be considered as ICT third-party service providers under this Regulation. Lastly, in light of the evolving payment services market becoming increasingly dependent on complex technical solutions, and in view of emerging types of payment services and payment-related solutions, participants in the payment services ecosystem, providing payment-processing activities, or operating payment infrastructures, should also be considered to be ICT third-party service providers under this Regulation, with the exception of central banks when operating payment or securities settlement systems, and public authorities when providing ICT related services in the context of fulfilling State functions.\n\n- (64) A financial entity should at all times remain fully responsible for complying with its obligations set out in this Regulation. Financial entities should apply a proportionate approach to the monitoring of risks emerging at the level of the ICT third-party service providers, by duly considering the nature, scale, complexity and importance of their ICT-related dependencies, the criticality or importance of the services, processes or functions subject to the contractual arrangements and, ultimately, on the basis of a careful assessment of any potential impact on the continuity and quality of financial services at individual and at group level, as appropriate.\n\n- (65) The conduct of such monitoring should follow a strategic approach to ICT third-party risk formalised through the adoption by the financial entity’s management body of a dedicated ICT third-party risk strategy, rooted in a continuous screening of all ICT third-party dependencies. To enhance supervisory awareness of ICT third-party dependencies, and with a view to further supporting the work in the context of the Oversight Framework established by this Regulation, all financial entities should be required to maintain a register of information with all contractual arrangements about the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers. Financial supervisors should be able to request the full register, or to ask for specific sections thereof, and thus to obtain essential information for acquiring a broader understanding of the ICT dependencies of financial entities.\n\n- (66) A thorough pre-contracting analysis should underpin and precede the formal conclusion of contractual arrangements, in particular by focusing on elements such as the criticality or importance of the services supported by the envisaged ICT contract, the necessary supervisory approvals or other conditions, the possible concentration risk entailed, as well as applying due diligence in the process of selection and assessment of ICT third-party service providers and assessing potential conflicts of interest. For contractual arrangements concerning critical or important functions, financial entities should take into consideration the use by ICT third-party service providers of the most up-to-date and highest information security standards. Termination of contractual arrangements could be prompted at least by a series of circumstances showing shortfalls at the ICT third-party service provider level, in particular significant breaches of laws or contractual terms, circumstances revealing a potential alteration of the performance of the functions provided for in the contractual arrangements, evidence of weaknesses of the ICT third-party service provider in its overall ICT risk management, or circumstances indicating the inability of the relevant competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity.\n\n- (67) To address the systemic impact of ICT third-party concentration risk, this Regulation promotes a balanced solution by means of taking a flexible and gradual approach to such concentration risk since the imposition of any rigid caps or strict limitations might hinder the conduct of business and restrain the contractual freedom. Financial entities should thoroughly assess their envisaged contractual arrangements to identify the likelihood of such risk emerging, including by means of in-depth analyses of subcontracting arrangements, in particular when concluded with ICT third-party service providers established in a third country. At this stage, and with a view to striking a fair balance between the imperative of preserving contractual freedom and that of guaranteeing financial stability, it is not considered appropriate to set out rules on strict caps and limits to ICT third-party exposures. In the context of the Oversight Framework, a Lead Overseer, appointed pursuant to this Regulation, should, in respect to critical ICT third-party service providers, pay particular attention to fully grasp the magnitude of interdependences, discover specific instances where a high degree of concentration of critical ICT third-party service providers in the Union is likely to put a strain on the Union financial system’s stability and integrity and maintain a dialogue with critical ICT third-party service providers where that specific risk is identified.\n\n- (68) To evaluate and monitor on a regular basis the ability of an ICT third party service provider to securely provide services to a financial entity without adverse effects on a financial entity’s digital operational resilience, several key contractual elements with ICT third-party service providers should be harmonised. Such harmonisation should cover minimum areas which are crucial for enabling a full monitoring by the financial entity of the risks that could emerge from the ICT third-party service provider, from the perspective of a financial entity’s need to secure its digital resilience because it is deeply dependent on the stability, functionality, availability and security of the ICT services received.\n\n- (69) When renegotiating contractual arrangements to seek alignment with the requirements of this Regulation, financial entities and ICT third-party service providers should ensure the coverage of the key contractual provisions as provided for in this Regulation.\n\n- (70) The definition of ‘critical or important function’ provided for in this Regulation encompasses the ‘critical functions’ as defined in Article 2(1), point (35), of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20). Accordingly, functions deemed to be critical pursuant to Directive 2014/59/EU are included in the definition of critical functions within the meaning of this Regulation.\n\n- (71) Irrespective of the criticality or importance of the function supported by the ICT services, contractual arrangements should, in particular, provide for a specification of the complete descriptions of functions and services, of the locations where such functions are provided and where data is to be processed, as well as an indication of service level descriptions. Other essential elements to enable a financial entity’s monitoring of ICT third party risk are: contractual provisions specifying how the accessibility, availability, integrity, security and protection of personal data are ensured by the ICT third-party service provider, provisions laying down the relevant guarantees for enabling the access, recovery and return of data in the case of insolvency, resolution or discontinuation of the business operations of the ICT third-party service provider, as well as provisions requiring the ICT third-party service provider to provide assistance in case of ICT incidents in connection with the services provided, at no additional cost or at a cost determined ex-ante; provisions on the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate with the competent authorities and resolution authorities of the financial entity; and provisions on termination rights and related minimum notice periods for the termination of the contractual arrangements, in accordance with the expectations of competent authorities and resolution authorities.\n\n- (72) In addition to such contractual provisions, and with a view to ensuring that financial entities remain in full control of all developments occurring at third-party level which may impair their ICT security, the contracts for the provision of ICT services supporting critical or important functions should also provide for the following: the specification of the full service level descriptions, with precise quantitative and qualitative performance targets, to enable without undue delay appropriate corrective actions when the agreed service levels are not met; the relevant notice periods and reporting obligations of the ICT third-party service provider in the event of developments with a potential material impact on the ICT third-party service provider’s ability to effectively provide their respective ICT services; a requirement upon the ICT third-party service provider to implement and test business contingency plans and have ICT security measures, tools and policies allowing for the secure provision of services, and to participate and fully cooperate in the TLPT carried out by the financial entity.\n\n- (73) Contracts for the provision of ICT services supporting critical or important functions should also contain provisions enabling the rights of access, inspection and audit by the financial entity, or an appointed third party, and the right to take copies as crucial instruments in the financial entities’ ongoing monitoring of the ICT third-party service provider’s performance, coupled with the service provider’s full cooperation during inspections. Similarly, the competent authority of the financial entity should have the right, based on notices, to inspect and audit the ICT third-party service provider, subject to the protection of confidential information.\n\n- (74) Such contractual arrangements should also provide for dedicated exit strategies to enable, in particular, mandatory transition periods during which ICT third-party service providers should continue providing the relevant services with a view to reducing the risk of disruptions at the level of the financial entity, or to allow the latter effectively to switch to the use of other ICT third-party service providers or, alternatively, to change to in-house solutions, consistent with the complexity of the provided ICT service. Moreover, financial entities within the scope of Directive 2014/59/EU should ensure that the relevant contracts for ICT services are robust and fully enforceable in the event of resolution of those financial entities. Therefore, in line with the expectations of the resolution authorities, those financial entities should ensure that the relevant contracts for ICT services are resolution resilient. As long as they continue meeting their payment obligations, those financial entities should ensure, among other requirements, that the relevant contracts for ICT services contain clauses for non-termination, non-suspension and non-modification on grounds of restructuring or resolution.\n\n- (75) Moreover, the voluntary use of standard contractual clauses developed by public authorities or Union institutions, in particular the use of contractual clauses developed by the Commission for cloud computing services could provide further comfort to the financial entities and ICT third-party service providers, by enhancing their level of legal certainty regarding the use of cloud computing services in the financial sector, in full alignment with the requirements and expectations set out by the Union financial services law. The development of standard contractual clauses builds on measures already envisaged in the 2018 Fintech Action Plan that announced the Commission’s intention to encourage and facilitate the development of standard contractual clauses for the use of cloud computing services outsourcing by financial entities, drawing on cross-sectorial cloud computing services stakeholders’ efforts, which the Commission has facilitated with the help of the financial sector’s involvement.\n\n- (76) With a view to promoting convergence and efficiency in relation to supervisory approaches when addressing ICT third-party risk in the financial sector, as well as to strengthening the digital operational resilience of financial entities which rely on critical ICT third-party service providers for the provision of ICT services that support the supply of financial services, and thereby to contributing to the preservation of the Union’s financial system stability and the integrity of the internal market for financial services, critical ICT third-party service providers should be subject to a Union Oversight Framework. While the set-up of the Oversight Framework is justified by the added value of taking action at Union level and by virtue of the inherent role and specificities of the use of ICT services in the provision of financial services, it should be recalled, at the same time, that this solution appears suitable only in the context of this Regulation specifically dealing with digital operational resilience in the financial sector. However, such Oversight Framework should not be regarded as a new model for Union supervision in other areas of financial services and activities.\n\n- (77) The Oversight Framework should apply only to critical ICT third-party service providers. There should therefore be a designation mechanism to take into account the dimension and nature of the financial sector’s reliance on such ICT third-party service providers. That mechanism should involve a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to set the criticality parameters as a basis for inclusion in the Oversight Framework. In order to ensure the accuracy of that assessment, and regardless of the corporate structure of the ICT third-party service provider, such criteria should, in the case of a ICT third-party service provider that is part of a wider group, take into consideration the entire ICT third-party service provider’s group structure. On the one hand, critical ICT third-party service providers, which are not automatically designated by virtue of the application of those criteria, should have the possibility to opt in to the Oversight Framework on a voluntary basis, on the other hand, ICT third-party service providers, that are already subject to oversight mechanism frameworks supporting the fulfilment of the tasks of the European System of Central Banks as referred to in Article 127(2) TFEU, should be exempted.\n\n- (78) Similarly, financial entities providing ICT services to other financial entities, while belonging to the category of ICT third-party service providers under this Regulation, should also be exempted from the Oversight Framework since they are already subject to supervisory mechanisms established by the relevant Union financial services law. Where applicable, competent authorities should take into account, in the context of their supervisory activities, the ICT risk posed to financial entities by financial entities providing ICT services. Likewise, due to the existing risk monitoring mechanisms at group level, the same exemption should be introduced for ICT third-party service providers delivering services predominantly to the entities of their own group. ICT third-party service providers providing ICT services solely in one Member State to financial entities that are active only in that Member State should also be exempted from the designation mechanism because of their limited activities and lack of cross-border impact.\n\n- (79) The digital transformation experienced in financial services has brought about an unprecedented level of use of, and reliance upon, ICT services. Since it has become inconceivable to provide financial services without the use of cloud computing services, software solutions and data-related services, the Union financial ecosystem has become intrinsically co-dependent on certain ICT services provided by ICT service suppliers. Some of those suppliers, innovators in developing and applying ICT-based technologies, play a significant role in the delivery of financial services, or have become integrated into the financial services value chain. They have thus become critical to the stability and integrity of the Union financial system. This widespread reliance on services supplied by critical ICT third-party service providers, combined with the interdependence of the information systems of various market operators, create a direct, and potentially severe, risk to the Union financial services system and to the continuity of delivery of financial services if critical ICT third-party service providers were to be affected by operational disruptions or major cyber incidents. Cyber incidents have a distinctive ability to multiply and propagate throughout the financial system at a considerably faster pace than other types of risk monitored in the financial sector and can extend across sectors and beyond geographical borders. They have the potential to evolve into a systemic crisis, where trust in the financial system has been eroded due to the disruption of functions supporting the real economy, or to substantial financial losses, reaching a level which the financial system is unable to withstand, or which requires the deployment of heavy shock absorption measures. To prevent these scenarios from taking place and thereby endangering the financial stability and integrity of the Union, it is essential to provide the convergence of supervisory practices relating to ICT third-party risk in finance, in particular through new rules enabling the Union oversight of critical ICT third-party service providers.\n\n- (80) The Oversight Framework largely depends on the degree of collaboration between the Lead Overseer and the critical ICT third-party service provider delivering to financial entities services affecting the supply of financial services. Successful oversight is predicated, inter alia, upon the ability of the Lead Overseer to effectively conduct monitoring missions and inspections to assess the rules, controls and processes used by the critical ICT third-party service providers, as well as to assess the potential cumulative impact of their activities on financial stability and the integrity of the financial system. At the same time, it is crucial that critical ICT third-party service providers follow the Lead Overseer’s recommendations and address its concerns. Since a lack of cooperation by a critical ICT third-party service provider providing services that affect the supply of financial services, such as the refusal to grant access to its premises or to submit information, would ultimately deprive the Lead Overseer of its essential tools in appraising ICT third-party risk, and could adversely impact the financial stability and the integrity of the financial system, it is necessary to also provide for a commensurate sanctioning regime.\n\n- (81) Against this background, the need of the Lead Overseer to impose penalty payments to compel critical ICT third-party service providers to comply with the transparency and access-related obligations set out in this Regulation should not be jeopardised by difficulties raised by the enforcement of those penalty payments in relation to critical ICT third-party service providers established in third countries. In order to ensure the enforceability of such penalties, and to allow a swift roll out of procedures upholding the critical ICT third-party service providers’ rights of defence in the context of the designation mechanism and the issuance of recommendations, those critical ICT third-party service providers, providing services to financial entities that affect the supply of financial services, should be required to maintain an adequate business presence in the Union. Due to the nature of the oversight, and the absence of comparable arrangements in other jurisdictions, there are no suitable alternative mechanisms ensuring this objective by way of effective cooperation with financial supervisors in third countries in relation to the monitoring of the impact of digital operational risks posed by systemic ICT third-party service providers, qualifying as critical ICT third-party service providers established in third countries. Therefore, in order to continue its provision of ICT services to financial entities in the Union, an ICT third-party service provider established in a third country which has been designated as critical in accordance with this Regulation should undertake, within 12 months of such designation, all necessary arrangements to ensure its incorporation within the Union, by means of establishing a subsidiary, as defined throughout the Union acquis, namely in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (21).\n\n- (82) The requirement to set up a subsidiary in the Union should not prevent the critical ICT third-party service provider from supplying ICT services and related technical support from facilities and infrastructure located outside the Union. This Regulation does not impose a data localisation obligation as it does not require data storage or processing to be undertaken in the Union.\n\n- (83) Critical ICT third-party service providers should be able to provide ICT services from anywhere in the world, not necessarily or not only from premises located in the Union. Oversight activities should be first conducted on premises located in the Union and by interacting with entities located in the Union, including the subsidiaries established by critical ICT third-party service providers pursuant to this Regulation. However, such actions within the Union might be insufficient to allow the Lead Overseer to fully and effectively perform its duties under this Regulation. The Lead Overseer should therefore also be able to exercise its relevant oversight powers in third countries. Exercising those powers in third countries should allow the Lead Overseer to examine the facilities from which the ICT services or the technical support services are actually provided or managed by the critical ICT third-party service provider, and should give the Lead Overseer a comprehensive and operational understanding of the ICT risk management of the critical ICT third-party service provider. The possibility for the Lead Overseer, as a Union agency, to exercise powers outside the territory of the Union should be duly framed by relevant conditions, in particular the consent of the critical ICT third-party service provider concerned. Similarly, the relevant authorities of the third country should be informed of, and not have objected to, the exercise on their own territory of the activities of the Lead Overseer. However, in order to ensure efficient implementation, and without prejudice to the respective competences of the Union institutions and the Member States, such powers also need to be fully anchored in the conclusion of administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant authorities of the third country concerned. This Regulation should therefore enable the ESAs to conclude administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant authorities of third countries, which should not otherwise create legal obligations in respect of the Union and its Member States.\n\n- (84) To facilitate communication with the Lead Overseer and to ensure adequate representation, critical ICT third-party service providers which are part of a group should designate one legal person as their coordination point.\n\n- (85) The Oversight Framework should be without prejudice to Member States’ competence to conduct their own oversight or monitoring missions in respect to ICT third-party service providers which are not designated as critical under this Regulation, but which are regarded as important at national level.\n\n- (86) To leverage the multi-layered institutional architecture in the financial services area, the Joint Committee of the ESAs should continue to ensure overall cross-sectoral coordination in relation to all matters pertaining to ICT risk, in accordance with its tasks on cybersecurity. It should be supported by a new Subcommittee (the ‘Oversight Forum’) carrying out preparatory work both for the individual decisions addressed to critical ICT third-party service providers, and for the issuing of collective recommendations, in particular in relation to benchmarking the oversight programmes for critical ICT third-party service providers, and identifying best practices for addressing ICT concentration risk issues.\n\n- (87) To ensure that critical ICT third-party service providers are appropriately and effectively overseen on a Union level, this Regulation provides that any of the three ESAs could be designated as a Lead Overseer. The individual assignment of a critical ICT third-party service provider to one of the three ESAs should result from an assessment of the preponderance of financial entities operating in the financial sectors for which that ESA has responsibilities. This approach should lead to a balanced allocation of tasks and responsibilities between the three ESAs, in the context of exercising the oversight functions, and should make the best use of the human resources and technical expertise available in each of the three ESAs.\n\n- (88) Lead Overseers should be granted the necessary powers to conduct investigations, to carry out onsite and offsite inspections at the premises and locations of critical ICT third-party service providers and to obtain complete and updated information. Those powers should enable the Lead Overseer to acquire real insight into the type, dimension and impact of the ICT third-party risk posed to financial entities and ultimately to the Union’s financial system. Entrusting the ESAs with the lead oversight role is a prerequisite for understanding and addressing the systemic dimension of ICT risk in finance. The impact of critical ICT third-party service providers on the Union financial sector and the potential issues caused by the ICT concentration risk entailed call for taking a collective approach at Union level. The simultaneous carrying out of multiple audits and access rights, performed separately by numerous competent authorities, with little or no coordination among them, would prevent financial supervisors from obtaining a complete and comprehensive overview of ICT third-party risk in the Union, while also creating redundancy, burden and complexity for critical ICT third-party service providers if they were subject to numerous monitoring and inspection requests.\n\n- (89) Due to the significant impact of being designated as critical, this Regulation should ensure that the rights of critical ICT third-party service providers are observed throughout the implementation of the Oversight Framework. Prior to being designated as critical, such providers should, for example, have the right to submit to the Lead Overseer a reasoned statement containing any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment related to their designation. Since the Lead Overseer should be empowered to submit recommendations on ICT risk matters and suitable remedies thereto, which include the power to oppose certain contractual arrangements ultimately affecting the stability of the financial entity or the financial system, critical ICT third-party service providers should also be given the opportunity to provide, prior to the finalisation of those recommendations, explanations regarding the expected impact of the solutions, envisaged in the recommendations, on customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation and to formulate solutions to mitigate risks. Critical ICT third-party service providers disagreeing with the recommendations should submit a reasoned explanation of their intention not to endorse the recommendation. Where such reasoned explanation is not submitted or where it is considered to be insufficient, the Lead Overseer should issue a public notice summarily describing the matter of non-compliance.\n\n- (90) Competent authorities should duly include the task of verifying substantive compliance with recommendations issued by the Lead Overseer in their functions with regard to prudential supervision of financial entities. Competent authorities should be able to require financial entities to take additional measures to address the risks identified in the Lead Overseer’s recommendations, and should, in due course, issue notifications to that effect. Where the Lead Overseer addresses recommendations to critical ICT third-party service providers that are supervised under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the competent authorities should be able, on a voluntary basis and before adopting additional measures, to consult the competent authorities under that Directive in order to foster a coordinated approach to dealing with the critical ICT third-party service providers in question.\n\n- (91) The exercise of the oversight should be guided by three operational principles seeking to ensure: (a) close coordination among the ESAs in their Lead Overseer roles, through a joint oversight network (JON), (b) consistency with the framework established by Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (through a voluntary consultation of bodies under that Directive to avoid duplication of measures directed at critical ICT third-party service providers), and (c) applying diligence to minimise the potential risk of disruption to services provided by the critical ICT third-party service providers to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation.\n\n- (92) The Oversight Framework should not replace, or in any way or for any part substitute for, the requirement for financial entities to manage themselves the risks entailed by the use of ICT third-party service providers, including their obligation to maintain an ongoing monitoring of contractual arrangements concluded with critical ICT third-party service providers. Similarly, the Oversight Framework should not affect the full responsibility of financial entities for complying with, and discharging, all the legal obligations laid down in this Regulation and in the relevant financial services law.\n\n- (93) To avoid duplications and overlaps, competent authorities should refrain from taking individually any measures aiming to monitor the critical ICT third-party service provider’s risks and should, in that respect, rely on the relevant Lead Overseer’s assessment. Any measures should in any case be coordinated and agreed in advance with the Lead Overseer in the context of the exercise of tasks in the Oversight Framework.\n\n- (94) To promote convergence at international level as regards the use of best practices in the review and monitoring of ICT third-party service providers’ digital risk-management, the ESAs should be encouraged to conclude cooperation arrangements with relevant supervisory and regulatory third-country authorities.\n\n- (95) To leverage the specific competences, technical skills and expertise of staff specialising in operational and ICT risk within the competent authorities, the three ESAs and, on a voluntary basis, the competent authorities under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the Lead Overseer should draw on national supervisory capabilities and knowledge and set up dedicated examination teams for each critical ICT third-party service provider, pooling multidisciplinary teams in support of the preparation and execution of oversight activities, including general investigations and inspections of critical ICT third-party service providers, as well as for any necessary follow-up thereto.\n\n- (96) Whereas costs resulting from oversight tasks would be fully funded from fees levied on critical ICT third-party service providers, the ESAs are. however, likely to incur, before the start of the Oversight Framework, costs for the implementation of dedicated ICT systems supporting the upcoming oversight, since dedicated ICT systems would need to be developed and deployed beforehand. This Regulation therefore provides for a hybrid funding model, whereby the Oversight Framework would, as such, be fully fee-funded, while the development of the ESAs’ ICT systems would be funded from Union and national competent authorities’ contributions.\n\n- (97) Competent authorities should have all required supervisory, investigative and sanctioning powers to ensure the proper exercise of their duties under this Regulation. They should, in principle, publish notices of the administrative penalties they impose. Since financial entities and ICT third-party service providers can be established in different Member States and supervised by different competent authorities, the application of this Regulation should be facilitated by, on the one hand, close cooperation among relevant competent authorities, including the ECB with regard to specific tasks conferred on it by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, and, on the other hand, by consultation with the ESAs through the mutual exchange of information and the provision of assistance in the context of relevant supervisory activities.\n\n- (98) In order to further quantify and qualify the criteria for the designation of ICT third-party service providers as critical and to harmonise oversight fees, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by further specifying the systemic impact that a failure or operational outage of an ICT third-party service provider could have on the financial entities it provides ICT services to, the number of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), that rely on the ICT third-party service provider in question, the number of ICT third-party service providers active on a given market, the costs of migrating data and ICT workloads to other ICT third-party service providers, as well as the amount of the oversight fees and the way in which they are to be paid. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (22). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n- (99) Regulatory technical standards should ensure the consistent harmonisation of the requirements laid down in this Regulation. In their roles as bodies endowed with highly specialised expertise, the ESAs should develop draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission. Regulatory technical standards should be developed in the areas of ICT risk management, major ICT-related incident reporting, testing, as well as in relation to key requirements for a sound monitoring of ICT third-party risk. The Commission and the ESAs should ensure that those standards and requirements can be applied by all financial entities in a manner that is proportionate to their size and overall risk profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their services, activities and operations. The Commission should be empowered to adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n- (100) To facilitate the comparability of reports on major ICT-related incidents and major operational or security payment-related incidents, as well as to ensure transparency regarding contractual arrangements for the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers, the ESAs should develop draft implementing technical standards establishing standardised templates, forms and procedures for financial entities to report a major ICT-related incident and a major operational or security payment-related incident, as well as standardised templates for the register of information. When developing those standards, the ESAs should take into account the size and the overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations. The Commission should be empowered to adopt those implementing technical standards by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n- (101) Since further requirements have already been specified through delegated and implementing acts based on technical regulatory and implementing technical standards in Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 (23), (EU) No 648/2012 (24), (EU) No 600/2014 (25) and (EU) No 909/2014 (26) of the European Parliament and of the Council, it is appropriate to mandate the ESAs, either individually or jointly through the Joint Committee, to submit regulatory and implementing technical standards to the Commission for adoption of delegated and implementing acts carrying over and updating existing ICT risk management rules.\n\n- (102) Since this Regulation, together with Directive (EU) 2022/2556 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27), entails a consolidation of the ICT risk management provisions across multiple regulations and directives of the Union’s financial services acquis, including Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014 and (EU) No 909/2014, and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28), in order to ensure full consistency, those Regulations should be amended to clarify that the applicable ICT risk-related provisions are laid down in this Regulation.\n\n- (103) Consequently, the scope of the relevant articles related to operational risk, upon which empowerments laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014, (EU) No 909/2014, and (EU) 2016/1011 had mandated the adoption of delegated and implementing acts, should be narrowed down with a view to carry over into this Regulation all provisions covering the digital operational resilience aspects which today are part of those Regulations.\n\n- (104) The potential systemic cyber risk associated with the use of ICT infrastructures that enable the operation of payment systems and the provision of payment processing activities should be duly addressed at Union level through harmonised digital resilience rules. To that effect, the Commission should swiftly assess the need for reviewing the scope of this Regulation while aligning such review with the outcome of the comprehensive review envisaged under Directive (EU) 2015/2366. Numerous large-scale attacks over the past decade demonstrate how payment systems have become exposed to cyber threats. Placed at the core of the payment services chain and showing strong interconnections with the overall financial system, payment systems and payment processing activities acquired a critical significance for the functioning of the Union financial markets. Cyber-attacks on such systems can cause severe operational business disruptions with direct repercussions on key economic functions, such as the facilitation of payments, and indirect effects on related economic processes. Until a harmonised regime and the supervision of operators of payment systems and processing entities are put in place at Union level, Member States may, with a view to applying similar market practices, draw inspiration from the digital operational resilience requirements laid down by this Regulation, when applying rules to operators of payment systems and processing entities supervised under their own jurisdictions.\n\n- (105) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to achieve a high level of digital operational resilience for regulated financial entities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because it requires harmonisation of various different rules in Union and national law, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n- (106) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (29) and delivered an opinion on 10 May 2021 (30),\n\n- (1) in Annex I, Section A, point 4, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n- (2) in Annex III, point 12 is replaced by the following:\n\n- (1) Article 26 is amended as follows:\n\n- (2) Article 34 is amended as follows:\n\n- (3) in Article 56(3), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n- (4) in Article 79, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\n\n- (5) in Article 80, paragraph 1 is deleted.\n\n- (6) in Annex I, Section II is amended as follows:\n\n- (7) Annex III is amended as follows:\n\n- (1) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\n- (2) paragraph 2 is deleted;\n\n- (3) paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:\n\n- (4) paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:\n\n- (5) in paragraph 7, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n- (1) Article 27g is amended as follows:\n\n- (2) Article 27h is amended as follows:\n\n- (3) Article 27i is amended as follows:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n## I. General Provisions\n\n### Article 1\n\n**Subject matter**\n\n1.

Data reporting service providers shall, in addition, have in place systems that can effectively check trade reports for completeness, identify omissions and obvious errors, and request re-transmission of those reports.\n\n### Article 11\n\n**Response and recovery**\n\n1. As part of the ICT risk management framework referred to in Article 6(1) and based on the identification requirements set out in Article 8, financial entities shall put in place a comprehensive ICT business continuity policy, which may be adopted as a dedicated specific policy, forming an integral part of the overall business continuity policy of the financial entity.\n\n2. Financial entities shall implement the ICT business continuity policy through dedicated, appropriate and documented arrangements, plans, procedures and mechanisms aiming to:\n\n- (a) ensure the continuity of the financial entity’s critical or important functions;\n- (b) quickly, appropriately and effectively respond to, and resolve, all ICT-related incidents in a way that limits damage and prioritises the resumption of activities and recovery actions;\n- (c) activate, without delay, dedicated plans that enable containment measures, processes and technologies suited to each type of ICT-related incident and prevent further damage, as well as tailored response and recovery procedures established in accordance with Article 12;\n- (d) estimate preliminary impacts, damages and losses;\n- (e) set out communication and crisis management actions that ensure that updated information is transmitted to all relevant internal staff and external stakeholders in accordance with Article 14, and report to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 19.\n3. As part of the ICT risk management framework referred to in Article 6(1), financial entities shall implement associated ICT response and recovery plans which, in the case of financial entities other than microenterprises, shall be subject to independent internal audit reviews.\n\n4. Financial entities shall put in place, maintain and periodically test appropriate ICT business continuity plans, notably with regard to critical or important functions outsourced or contracted through arrangements with ICT third-party service providers.\n\n5. As part of the overall business continuity policy, financial entities shall conduct a business impact analysis (BIA) of their exposures to severe business disruptions. Under the BIA, financial entities shall assess the potential impact of severe business disruptions by means of quantitative and qualitative criteria, using internal and external data and scenario analysis, as appropriate. The BIA shall consider the criticality of identified and mapped business functions, support processes, third-party dependencies and information assets, and their interdependencies. Financial entities shall ensure that ICT assets and ICT services are designed and used in full alignment with the BIA, in particular with regard to adequately ensuring the redundancy of all critical components.\n\n6. As part of their comprehensive ICT risk management, financial entities shall:\n\n- (a) test the ICT business continuity plans and the ICT response and recovery plans in relation to ICT systems supporting all functions at least yearly, as well as in the event of any substantive changes to ICT systems supporting critical or important functions;\n- (b) test the crisis communication plans established in accordance with Article 14.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall include in the testing plans scenarios of cyber-attacks and switchovers between the primary ICT infrastructure and the redundant capacity, backups and redundant facilities necessary to meet the obligations set out in Article 12.\n\nFinancial entities shall regularly review their ICT business continuity policy and ICT response and recovery plans, taking into account the results of tests carried out in accordance with the first subparagraph and recommendations stemming from audit checks or supervisory reviews.\n\n7. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall have a crisis management function, which, in the event of activation of their ICT business continuity plans or ICT response and recovery plans, shall, inter alia, set out clear procedures to manage internal and external crisis communications in accordance with Article 14.\n\n8. Financial entities shall keep readily accessible records of activities before and during disruption events when their ICT business continuity plans and ICT response and recovery plans are activated.\n\n9. Central securities depositories shall provide the competent authorities with copies of the results of the ICT business continuity tests, or of similar exercises.\n\n10. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall report to the competent authorities, upon their request, an estimation of aggregated annual costs and losses caused by major ICT-related incidents.\n\n11. In accordance with Article 16 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010, the ESAs, through the Joint Committee, shall by 17 July 2024 develop common guidelines on the estimation of aggregated annual costs and losses referred to in paragraph 10.\n\n### Article 12\n\n**Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods**\n\n1. For the purpose of ensuring the restoration of ICT systems and data with minimum downtime, limited disruption and loss, as part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities shall develop and document:\n\n- (a) backup policies and procedures specifying the scope of the data that is subject to the backup and the minimum frequency of the backup, based on the criticality of information or the confidentiality level of the data;\n- (b) restoration and recovery procedures and methods.\n2. Financial entities shall set up backup systems that can be activated in accordance with the backup policies and procedures, as well as restoration and recovery procedures and methods. The activation of backup systems shall not jeopardise the security of the network and information systems or the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data. Testing of the backup procedures and restoration and recovery procedures and methods shall be undertaken periodically.\n\n3. When restoring backup data using own systems, financial entities shall use ICT systems that are physically and logically segregated from the source ICT system. The ICT systems shall be securely protected from any unauthorised access or ICT corruption and allow for the timely restoration of services making use of data and system backups as necessary.\n\nFor central counterparties, the recovery plans shall enable the recovery of all transactions at the time of disruption to allow the central counterparty to continue to operate with certainty and to complete settlement on the scheduled date.\n\nData reporting service providers shall additionally maintain adequate resources and have back-up and restoration facilities in place in order to offer and maintain their services at all times.\n\n4. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall maintain redundant ICT capacities equipped with resources, capabilities and functions that are adequate to ensure business needs. Microenterprises shall assess the need to maintain such redundant ICT capacities based on their risk profile.\n\n5. Central securities depositories shall maintain at least one secondary processing site endowed with adequate resources, capabilities, functions and staffing arrangements to ensure business needs.\n\nThe secondary processing site shall be:\n\n- (a) located at a geographical distance from the primary processing site to ensure that it bears a distinct risk profile and to prevent it from being affected by the event which has affected the primary site;\n- (b) capable of ensuring the continuity of critical or important functions identically to the primary site, or providing the level of services necessary to ensure that the financial entity performs its critical operations within the recovery objectives;\n- (c) immediately accessible to the financial entity’s staff to ensure continuity of critical or important functions in the event that the primary processing site has become unavailable.\n6. In determining the recovery time and recovery point objectives for each function, financial entities shall take into account whether it is a critical or important function and the potential overall impact on market efficiency. Such time objectives shall ensure that, in extreme scenarios, the agreed service levels are met.\n\n7. When recovering from an ICT-related incident, financial entities shall perform necessary checks, including any multiple checks and reconciliations, in order to ensure that the highest level of data integrity is maintained. These checks shall also be performed when reconstructing data from external stakeholders, in order to ensure that all data is consistent between systems.\n\n### Article 13\n\n**Learning and evolving**\n\n1. Financial entities shall have in place capabilities and staff to gather information on vulnerabilities and cyber threats, ICT-related incidents, in particular cyber-attacks, and analyse the impact they are likely to have on their digital operational resilience.\n\n2. Financial entities shall put in place post ICT-related incident reviews after a major ICT-related incident disrupts their core activities, analysing the causes of disruption and identifying required improvements to the ICT operations or within the ICT business continuity policy referred to in Article 11.\n\nFinancial entities, other than microenterprises, shall, upon request, communicate to the competent authorities, the changes that were implemented following post ICT-related incident reviews as referred to in the first subparagraph.\n\nThe post ICT-related incident reviews referred to in the first subparagraph shall determine whether the established procedures were followed and the actions taken were effective, including in relation to the following:\n\n- (a) the promptness in responding to security alerts and determining the impact of ICT-related incidents and their severity;\n- (b) the quality and speed of performing a forensic analysis, where deemed appropriate;\n- (c) the effectiveness of incident escalation within the financial entity;\n- (d) the effectiveness of internal and external communication.\n3. Lessons derived from the digital operational resilience testing carried out in accordance with Articles 26 and 27 and from real life ICT-related incidents, in particular cyber-attacks, along with challenges faced upon the activation of ICT business continuity plans and ICT response and recovery plans, together with relevant information exchanged with counterparts and assessed during supervisory reviews, shall be duly incorporated on a continuous basis into the ICT risk assessment process. Those findings shall form the basis for appropriate reviews of relevant components of the ICT risk management framework referred to in Article 6(1).\n\n4. Financial entities shall monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of their digital operational resilience strategy set out in Article 6(8). They shall map the evolution of ICT risk over time, analyse the frequency, types, magnitude and evolution of ICT-related incidents, in particular cyber-attacks and their patterns, with a view to understanding the level of ICT risk exposure, in particular in relation to critical or important functions, and enhance the cyber maturity and preparedness of the financial entity.\n\n5. Senior ICT staff shall report at least yearly to the management body on the findings referred to in paragraph 3 and put forward recommendations.\n\n6. Financial entities shall develop ICT security awareness programmes and digital operational resilience training as compulsory modules in their staff training schemes. Those programmes and training shall be applicable to all employees and to senior management staff, and shall have a level of complexity commensurate to the remit of their functions. Where appropriate, financial entities shall also include ICT third-party service providers in their relevant training schemes in accordance with Article 30(2), point (i).\n\n7. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall monitor relevant technological developments on a continuous basis, also with a view to understanding the possible impact of the deployment of such new technologies on ICT security requirements and digital operational resilience. They shall keep up-to-date with the latest ICT risk management processes, in order to effectively combat current or new forms of cyber-attacks.\n\n### Article 14\n\n**Communication**\n\n1. As part of the ICT risk management framework referred to in Article 6(1), financial entities shall have in place crisis communication plans enabling a responsible disclosure of, at least, major ICT-related incidents or vulnerabilities to clients and counterparts as well as to the public, as appropriate.\n\n2. As part of the ICT risk management framework, financial entities shall implement communication policies for internal staff and for external stakeholders. Communication policies for staff shall take into account the need to differentiate between staff involved in ICT risk management, in particular the staff responsible for response and recovery, and staff that needs to be informed.\n\n3. At least one person in the financial entity shall be tasked with implementing the communication strategy for ICT-related incidents and fulfil the public and media function for that purpose.\n\n### Article 15\n\n**Further harmonisation of ICT risk management tools, methods, processes and policies**\n\nThe ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, in consultation with the European Union Agency on Cybersecurity (ENISA), develop common draft regulatory technical standards in order to:\n\n- (a) specify further elements to be included in the ICT security policies, procedures, protocols and tools referred to in Article 9(2), with a view to ensuring the security of networks, enable adequate safeguards against intrusions and data misuse, preserve the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data, including cryptographic techniques, and guarantee an accurate and prompt data transmission without major disruptions and undue delays;\n- (b) develop further components of the controls of access management rights referred to in Article 9(4), point (c), and associated human resource policy specifying access rights, procedures for granting and revoking rights, monitoring anomalous behaviour in relation to ICT risk through appropriate indicators, including for network use patterns, hours, IT activity and unknown devices;\n- (c) develop further the mechanisms specified in Article 10(1) enabling a prompt detection of anomalous activities and the criteria set out in Article 10(2) triggering ICT-related incident detection and response processes;\n- (d) specify further the components of the ICT business continuity policy referred to in Article 11(1);\n- (e) specify further the testing of ICT business continuity plans referred to in Article 11(6) to ensure that such testing duly takes into account scenarios in which the quality of the provision of a critical or important function deteriorates to an unacceptable level or fails, and duly considers the potential impact of the insolvency, or other failures, of any relevant ICT third-party service provider and, where relevant, the political risks in the respective providers’ jurisdictions;\n- (f) specify further the components of the ICT response and recovery plans referred to in Article 11(3);\n- (g) specifying further the content and format of the report on the review of the ICT risk management framework referred to in Article 6(5);\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into account the size and the overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations, while duly taking into consideration any specific feature arising from the distinct nature of activities across different financial services sectors.\n\nThe ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n### Article 16\n\n**Simplified ICT risk management framework**\n\n1.

It shall be continuously improved on the basis of lessons derived from implementation and monitoring. A report on the review of the ICT risk management framework shall be submitted to the competent authority upon its request.\n\n3. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, in consultation with the ENISA, develop common draft regulatory technical standards in order to:\n\n- (a) specify further the elements to be included in the ICT risk management framework referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (a);\n- (b) specify further the elements in relation to systems, protocols and tools to minimise the impact of ICT risk referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (c), with a view to ensuring the security of networks, enabling adequate safeguards against intrusions and data misuse and preserving the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data;\n- (c) specify further the components of the ICT business continuity plans referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (f);\n- (d) specify further the rules on the testing of business continuity plans and ensure the effectiveness of the controls referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (g) and ensure that such testing duly takes into account scenarios in which the quality of the provision of a critical or important function deteriorates to an unacceptable level or fails;\n- (e) specify further the content and format of the report on the review of the ICT risk management framework referred to in paragraph 2.\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into account the size and the overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations.\n\nThe ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n## III. ICT-related Incident Management, Classification and Reporting\n\n### Article 17\n\n**ICT-related incident management process**\n\n1. Financial entities shall define, establish and implement an ICT-related incident management process to detect, manage and notify ICT-related incidents.\n\n2. Financial entities shall record all ICT-related incidents and significant cyber threats. Financial entities shall establish appropriate procedures and processes to ensure a consistent and integrated monitoring, handling and follow-up of ICT-related incidents, to ensure that root causes are identified, documented and addressed in order to prevent the occurrence of such incidents.\n\n3. The ICT-related incident management process referred to in paragraph 1 shall:\n\n- (a) put in place early warning indicators;\n- (b) establish procedures to identify, track, log, categorise and classify ICT-related incidents according to their priority and severity and according to the criticality of the services impacted, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 18(1);\n- (c) assign roles and responsibilities that need to be activated for different ICT-related incident types and scenarios;\n- (d) set out plans for communication to staff, external stakeholders and media in accordance with Article 14 and for notification to clients, for internal escalation procedures, including ICT-related customer complaints, as well as for the provision of information to financial entities that act as counterparts, as appropriate;\n- (e) ensure that at least major ICT-related incidents are reported to relevant senior management and inform the management body of at least major ICT-related incidents, explaining the impact, response and additional controls to be established as a result of such ICT-related incidents;\n- (f) establish ICT-related incident response procedures to mitigate impacts and ensure that services become operational and secure in a timely manner.\n### Article 18\n\n**Classification of ICT-related incidents and cyber threats**\n\n1. Financial entities shall classify ICT-related incidents and shall determine their impact based on the following criteria:\n\n- (a) the number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts affected and, where applicable, the amount or number of transactions affected by the ICT-related incident, and whether the ICT-related incident has caused reputational impact;\n- (b) the duration of the ICT-related incident, including the service downtime;\n- (c) the geographical spread with regard to the areas affected by the ICT-related incident, particularly if it affects more than two Member States;\n- (d) the data losses that the ICT-related incident entails, in relation to availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data;\n- (e) the criticality of the services affected, including the financial entity’s transactions and operations;\n- (f) the economic impact, in particular direct and indirect costs and losses, of the ICT-related incident in both absolute and relative terms.\n2. Financial entities shall classify cyber threats as significant based on the criticality of the services at risk, including the financial entity’s transactions and operations, number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts targeted and the geographical spread of the areas at risk.\n\n3. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee and in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, develop common draft regulatory technical standards further specifying the following:\n\n- (a) the criteria set out in paragraph 1, including materiality thresholds for determining major ICT-related incidents or, as applicable, major operational or security payment-related incidents, that are subject to the reporting obligation laid down in Article 19(1);\n- (b) the criteria to be applied by competent authorities for the purpose of assessing the relevance of major ICT-related incidents or, as applicable, major operational or security payment-related incidents, to relevant competent authorities in other Member States’, and the details of reports of major ICT-related incidents or, as applicable, major operational or security payment-related incidents, to be shared with other competent authorities pursuant to Article 19(6) and (7);\n- (c) the criteria set out in paragraph 2 of this Article, including high materiality thresholds for determining significant cyber threats.\n4.

For the purposes of applying the criteria set out in Article 4(2), the ESAs shall duly consider the need for microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises to mobilise sufficient resources and capabilities to ensure that ICT-related incidents are managed swiftly.\n\nThe ESAs shall submit those common draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 3 in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n### Article 19\n\n**Reporting of major ICT-related incidents and voluntary notification of significant cyber threats**\n\n1. Financial entities shall report major ICT-related incidents to the relevant competent authority as referred to in Article 46 in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.\n\nWhere a financial entity is subject to supervision by more than one national competent authority referred to in Article 46, Member States shall designate a single competent authority as the relevant competent authority responsible for carrying out the functions and duties provided for in this Article.\n\nCredit institutions classified as significant, in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall report major ICT-related incidents to the relevant national competent authority designated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which shall immediately transmit that report to the ECB.\n\nFor the purpose of the first subparagraph, financial entities shall produce, after collecting and analysing all relevant information, the initial notification and reports referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article using the templates referred to in Article 20 and submit them to the competent authority. In the event that a technical impossibility prevents the submission of the initial notification using the template, financial entities shall notify the competent authority about it via alternative means.\n\nThe initial notification and reports referred to in paragraph 4 shall include all information necessary for the competent authority to determine the significance of the major ICT-related incident and assess possible cross-border impacts.\n\nWithout prejudice to the reporting pursuant to the first subparagraph by the financial entity to the relevant competent authority, Member States may additionally determine that some or all financial entities shall also provide the initial notification and each report referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article using the templates referred to in Article 20 to the competent authorities or the computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555.\n\n2. Financial entities may, on a voluntary basis, notify significant cyber threats to the relevant competent authority when they deem the threat to be of relevance to the financial system, service users or clients. The relevant competent authority may provide such information to other relevant authorities referred to in paragraph 6.\n\nCredit institutions classified as significant, in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, may, on a voluntary basis, notify significant cyber threats to relevant national competent authority, designated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which shall immediately transmit the notification to the ECB.\n\nMember States may determine that those financial entities that on a voluntary basis notify in accordance with the first subparagraph may also transmit that notification to the CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555.\n\n3. Where a major ICT-related incident occurs and has an impact on the financial interests of clients, financial entities shall, without undue delay as soon as they become aware of it, inform their clients about the major ICT-related incident and about the measures that have been taken to mitigate the adverse effects of such incident.\n\nIn the case of a significant cyber threat, financial entities shall, where applicable, inform their clients that are potentially affected of any appropriate protection measures which the latter may consider taking.\n\n4. Financial entities shall, within the time limits to be laid down in accordance with Article 20, first paragraph, point (a), point (ii), submit the following to the relevant competent authority:\n\n- (a) an initial notification;\n- (b) an intermediate report after the initial notification referred to in point (a), as soon as the status of the original incident has changed significantly or the handling of the major ICT-related incident has changed based on new information available, followed, as appropriate, by updated notifications every time a relevant status update is available, as well as upon a specific request of the competent authority;\n- (c) a final report, when the root cause analysis has been completed, regardless of whether mitigation measures have already been implemented, and when the actual impact figures are available to replace estimates.\n5. Financial entities may outsource, in accordance with Union and national sectoral law, the reporting obligations under this Article to a third-party service provider. In case of such outsourcing, the financial entity remains fully responsible for the fulfilment of the incident reporting requirements.\n\n6. Upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report referred to in paragraph 4, the competent authority shall, in a timely manner, provide details of the major ICT-related incident to the following recipients based, as applicable, on their respective competences:\n\n- (a) EBA, ESMA or EIOPA;\n- (b) the ECB, in the case of financial entities referred to in Article 2(1), points (a), (b) and (d);\n- (c) the competent authorities, single points of contact or CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555;\n- (d) the resolution authorities, as referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU, and the Single Resolution Board (SRB) with respect to entities referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (37), and with respect to entities and groups referred to in Article 7(4)(b) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 if such details concern incidents that pose a risk to ensuring critical functions within the meaning of Article 2(1), point (35), of Directive 2014/59/EU; and\n- (e) other relevant public authorities under national law.\n7. Following receipt of information in accordance with paragraph 6, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA and the ECB, in consultation with ENISA and in cooperation with the relevant competent authority, shall assess whether the major ICT-related incident is relevant for competent authorities in other Member States. Following that assessment, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA shall, as soon as possible, notify relevant competent authorities in other Member States accordingly. The ECB shall notify the members of the European System of Central Banks on issues relevant to the payment system. Based on that notification, the competent authorities shall, where appropriate, take all of the necessary measures to protect the immediate stability of the financial system.\n\n8. The notification to be done by ESMA pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article shall be without prejudice to the responsibility of the competent authority to urgently transmit the details of the major ICT-related incident to the relevant authority in the host Member State, where a central securities depository has significant cross-border activity in the host Member State, the major ICT-related incident is likely to have severe consequences for the financial markets of the host Member State and where there are cooperation arrangements among competent authorities related to the supervision of financial entities.\n\n### Article 20\n\n**Harmonisation of reporting content and templates**\n\nThe ESAs, through the Joint Committee, and in consultation with ENISA and the ECB, shall develop:\n\n- (a) common draft regulatory technical standards in order to:\n- (i) establish the content of the reports for major ICT-related incidents in order to reflect the criteria laid down in Article 18(1) and incorporate further elements, such as details for establishing the relevance of the reporting for other Member States and whether it constitutes a major operational or security payment-related incident or not;\n   - (ii) determine the time limits for the initial notification and for each report referred to in Article 19(4);\n\n   - (iii) establish the content of the notification for significant cyber threats.\n\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into account the size and the overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations, and in particular, with a view to ensuring that, for the purposes of this paragraph, point (a), point (ii), different time limits may reflect, as appropriate, specificities of financial sectors, without prejudice to maintaining a consistent approach to ICT-related incident reporting pursuant to this Regulation and to Directive (EU) 2022/2555. The ESAs shall, as applicable, provide justification when deviating from the approaches taken in the context of that Directive;\n\n- (b) common draft implementing technical standards in order to establish the standard forms, templates and procedures for financial entities to report a major ICT-related incident and to notify a significant cyber threat.\nThe ESAs shall submit the common draft regulatory technical standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (a), and the common draft implementing technical standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (b), to the Commission by 17 July 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the common regulatory technical standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (a), in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the common implementing technical standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (b), in accordance with Article 15 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n### Article 21\n\n**Centralisation of reporting of major ICT-related incidents**\n\n1. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee, and in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, shall prepare a joint report assessing the feasibility of further centralisation of incident reporting through the establishment of a single EU Hub for major ICT-related incident reporting by financial entities. The joint report shall explore ways to facilitate the flow of ICT-related incident reporting, reduce associated costs and underpin thematic analyses with a view to enhancing supervisory convergence.\n\n2. The joint report referred to in paragraph 1 shall comprise at least the following elements:\n\n- (a) prerequisites for the establishment of a single EU Hub;\n- (b) benefits, limitations and risks, including risks associated with the high concentration of sensitive information;\n- (c) the necessary capability to ensure interoperability with regard to other relevant reporting schemes;\n- (d) elements of operational management;\n- (e) conditions of membership;\n- (f) technical arrangements for financial entities and national competent authorities to access the single EU Hub;\n- (g) a preliminary assessment of financial costs incurred by setting-up the operational platform supporting the single EU Hub, including the requisite expertise.\n3.

Without prejudice to the technical input, advice or remedies and subsequent follow-up which may be provided, where applicable, in accordance with national law, by the CSIRTs under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the competent authority shall, upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report as referred to in Article 19(4), acknowledge receipt and may, where feasible, provide in a timely manner relevant and proportionate feedback or high-level guidance to the financial entity, in particular by making available any relevant anonymised information and intelligence on similar threats, and may discuss remedies applied at the level of the financial entity and ways to minimise and mitigate adverse impact across the financial sector. Without prejudice to the supervisory feedback received, financial entities shall remain fully responsible for the handling and for consequences of the ICT-related incidents reported pursuant to Article 19(1).\n\n2. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, on an anonymised and aggregated basis, report yearly on major ICT-related incidents, the details of which shall be provided by competent authorities in accordance with Article 19(6), setting out at least the number of major ICT-related incidents, their nature and their impact on the operations of financial entities or clients, remedial actions taken and costs incurred.\n\nThe ESAs shall issue warnings and produce high-level statistics to support ICT threat and vulnerability assessments.\n\n### Article 23\n\n**Operational or security payment-related incidents concerning credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, and electronic money institutions**\n\nThe requirements laid down in this Chapter shall also apply to operational or security payment-related incidents and to major operational or security payment-related incidents, where they concern credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, and electronic money institutions.\n\n## IV. Digital Operational Resilience Testing\n\n### Article 24\n\n**General requirements for the performance of digital operational resilience testing**\n\n1. For the purpose of assessing preparedness for handling ICT-related incidents, of identifying weaknesses, deficiencies and gaps in digital operational resilience, and of promptly implementing corrective measures, financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall, taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), establish, maintain and review a sound and comprehensive digital operational resilience testing programme as an integral part of the ICT risk-management framework referred to in Article 6.\n\n2. The digital operational resilience testing programme shall include a range of assessments, tests, methodologies, practices and tools to be applied in accordance with Articles 25 and 26.\n\n3. When conducting the digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall follow a risk-based approach taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2) duly considering the evolving landscape of ICT risk, any specific risks to which the financial entity concerned is or might be exposed, the criticality of information assets and of services provided, as well as any other factor the financial entity deems appropriate.\n\n4. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure that tests are undertaken by independent parties, whether internal or external. Where tests are undertaken by an internal tester, financial entities shall dedicate sufficient resources and ensure that conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test.\n\n5. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall establish procedures and policies to prioritise, classify and remedy all issues revealed throughout the performance of the tests and shall establish internal validation methodologies to ascertain that all identified weaknesses, deficiencies or gaps are fully addressed.\n\n6. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure, at least yearly, that appropriate tests are conducted on all ICT systems and applications supporting critical or important functions.\n\n### Article 25\n\n**Testing of ICT tools and systems**\n\n1. The digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in Article 24 shall provide, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 4(2), for the execution of appropriate tests, such as vulnerability assessments and scans, open source analyses, network security assessments, gap analyses, physical security reviews, questionnaires and scanning software solutions, source code reviews where feasible, scenario-based tests, compatibility testing, performance testing, end-to-end testing and penetration testing.\n\n2. Central securities depositories and central counterparties shall perform vulnerability assessments before any deployment or redeployment of new or existing applications and infrastructure components, and ICT services supporting critical or important functions of the financial entity.\n\n3. Microenterprises shall perform the tests referred to in paragraph 1 by combining a risk-based approach with a strategic planning of ICT testing, by duly considering the need to maintain a balanced approach between the scale of resources and the time to be allocated to the ICT testing provided for in this Article, on the one hand, and the urgency, type of risk, criticality of information assets and of services provided, as well as any other relevant factor, including the financial entity’s ability to take calculated risks, on the other hand.\n\n### Article 26\n\n**Advanced testing of ICT tools, systems and processes based on TLPT**\n\n1. Financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1), first subparagraph, and other than microenterprises, which are identified in accordance with paragraph 8, third subparagraph, of this Article, shall carry out at least every 3 years advanced testing by means of TLPT. Based on the risk profile of the financial entity and taking into account operational circumstances, the competent authority may, where necessary, request the financial entity to reduce or increase this frequency.\n\n2. Each threat-led penetration test shall cover several or all critical or important functions of a financial entity, and shall be performed on live production systems supporting such functions.\n\nFinancial entities shall identify all relevant underlying ICT systems, processes and technologies supporting critical or important functions and ICT services, including those supporting the critical or important functions which have been outsourced or contracted to ICT third-party service providers.\n\nFinancial entities shall assess which critical or important functions need to be covered by the TLPT. The result of this assessment shall determine the precise scope of TLPT and shall be validated by the competent authorities.\n\n3. Where ICT third-party service providers are included in the scope of TLPT, the financial entity shall take the necessary measures and safeguards to ensure the participation of such ICT third-party service providers in the TLPT and shall retain at all times full responsibility for ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n\n4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, first and second subparagraphs, where the participation of an ICT third-party service provider in the TLPT, referred to in paragraph 3, is reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on the quality or security of services delivered by the ICT third-party service provider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation, or on the confidentiality of the data related to such services, the financial entity and the ICT third-party service provider may agree in writing that the ICT third-party service provider directly enters into contractual arrangements with an external tester, for the purpose of conducting, under the direction of one designated financial entity, a pooled TLPT involving several financial entities (pooled testing) to which the ICT third-party service provider provides ICT services.\n\nThat pooled testing shall cover the relevant range of ICT services supporting critical or important functions contracted to the respective ICT third-party service provider by the financial entities. The pooled testing shall be considered TLPT carried out by the financial entities participating in the pooled testing.\n\nThe number of financial entities participating in the pooled testing shall be duly calibrated taking into account the complexity and types of services involved.\n\n5. Financial entities shall, with the cooperation of ICT third-party service providers and other parties involved, including the testers but excluding the competent authorities, apply effective risk management controls to mitigate the risks of any potential impact on data, damage to assets, and disruption to critical or important functions, services or operations at the financial entity itself, its counterparts or to the financial sector.\n\n6. At the end of the testing, after reports and remediation plans have been agreed, the financial entity and, where applicable, the external testers shall provide to the authority, designated in accordance with paragraph 9 or 10, a summary of the relevant findings, the remediation plans and the documentation demonstrating that the TLPT has been conducted in accordance with the requirements.\n\n7. Authorities shall provide financial entities with an attestation confirming that the test was performed in accordance with the requirements as evidenced in the documentation in order to allow for mutual recognition of threat led penetration tests between competent authorities. The financial entity shall notify the relevant competent authority of the attestation, the summary of the relevant findings and the remediation plans.\n\nWithout prejudice to such attestation, financial entities shall remain at all times fully responsible for the impact of the tests referred to in paragraph 4.\n\n8. Financial entities shall contract testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT in accordance with Article 27. When financial entities use internal testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT, they shall contract external testers every three tests.\n\nCredit institutions that are classified as significant in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall only use external testers in accordance with Article 27(1), points (a) to (e).\n\nCompetent authorities shall identify financial entities that are required to perform TLPT taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), based on an assessment of the following:\n\n- (a) impact-related factors, in particular the extent to which the services provided and activities undertaken by the financial entity impact the financial sector;\n- (b) possible financial stability concerns, including the systemic character of the financial entity at Union or national level, as applicable;\n- (c) specific ICT risk profile, level of ICT maturity of the financial entity or technology features involved.\n9. Member States may designate a single public authority in the financial sector to be responsible for TLPT-related matters in the financial sector at national level and shall entrust it with all competences and tasks to that effect.\n\n10. In the absence of a designation in accordance with paragraph 9 of this Article, and without prejudice to the power to identify the financial entities that are required to perform TLPT, a competent authority may delegate the exercise of some or all of the tasks referred to in this Article and Article 27 to another national authority in the financial sector.\n\n11. The ESAs shall, in agreement with the ECB, develop joint draft regulatory technical standards in accordance with the TIBER-EU framework in order to specify further:\n\n- (a) the criteria used for the purpose of the application of paragraph 8, second subparagraph;\n- (b) the requirements and standards governing the use of internal testers;\n- (c) the requirements in relation to:\n- (i) the scope of TLPT referred to in paragraph 2;\n   - (ii) the testing methodology and approach to be followed for each specific phase of the testing process;\n\n   - (iii) the results, closure and remediation stages of the testing;\n\n- (d) the type of supervisory and other relevant cooperation which are needed for the implementation of TLPT, and for the facilitation of mutual recognition of that testing, in the context of financial entities that operate in more than one Member State, to allow an appropriate level of supervisory involvement and a flexible implementation to cater for specificities of financial sub-sectors or local financial markets.\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall give due consideration to any specific feature arising from the distinct nature of activities across different financial services sectors.\n\nThe ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n### Article 27\n\n**Requirements for testers for the carrying out of TLPT**\n\n1. Financial entities shall only use testers for the carrying out of TLPT, that:\n\n- (a) are of the highest suitability and reputability;\n- (b) possess technical and organisational capabilities and demonstrate specific expertise in threat intelligence, penetration testing and red team testing;\n- (c) are certified by an accreditation body in a Member State or adhere to formal codes of conduct or ethical frameworks;\n- (d) provide an independent assurance, or an audit report, in relation to the sound management of risks associated with the carrying out of TLPT, including the due protection of the financial entity’s confidential information and redress for the business risks of the financial entity;\n- (e) are duly and fully covered by relevant professional indemnity insurances, including against risks of misconduct and negligence.\n2. When using internal testers, financial entities shall ensure that, in addition to the requirements in paragraph 1, the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a) such use has been approved by the relevant competent authority or by the single public authority designated in accordance with Article 26(9) and (10);\n- (b) the relevant competent authority has verified that the financial entity has sufficient dedicated resources and ensured that conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test; and\n- (c) the threat intelligence provider is external to the financial entity.\n3. Financial entities shall ensure that contracts concluded with external testers require a sound management of the TLPT results and that any data processing thereof, including any generation, store, aggregation, draft, report, communication or destruction, do not create risks to the financial entity.\n\n## V. Managing of ICT Third-party Risk\n\n### Section I — Key principles for a sound management of ICT third-party risk\n\n### Article 28\n\n**General principles**\n\n1. Financial entities shall manage ICT third-party risk as an integral component of ICT risk within their ICT risk management framework as referred to in Article 6(1), and in accordance with the following principles:\n\n- (a) financial entities that have in place contractual arrangements for the use of ICT services to run their business operations shall, at all times, remain fully responsible for compliance with, and the discharge of, all obligations under this Regulation and applicable financial services law;\n- (b) financial entities’ management of ICT third-party risk shall be implemented in light of the principle of proportionality, taking into account:\n- (i) the nature, scale, complexity and importance of ICT-related dependencies,\n   - (ii) the risks arising from contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services concluded with ICT third-party service providers, taking into account the criticality or importance of the respective service, process or function, and the potential impact on the continuity and availability of financial services and activities, at individual and at group level.\n\n2. As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1), first subparagraph, and other than microenterprises, shall adopt, and regularly review, a strategy on ICT third-party risk, taking into account the multi-vendor strategy referred to in Article 6(9), where applicable. The strategy on ICT third-party risk shall include a policy on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provided by ICT third-party service providers and shall apply on an individual basis and, where relevant, on a sub-consolidated and consolidated basis. The management body shall, on the basis of an assessment of the overall risk profile of the financial entity and the scale and complexity of the business services, regularly review the risks identified in respect to contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions.\n\n3. As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities shall maintain and update at entity level, and at sub-consolidated and consolidated levels, a register of information in relation to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers.\n\nThe contractual arrangements referred to in the first subparagraph shall be appropriately documented, distinguishing between those that cover ICT services supporting critical or important functions and those that do not.\n\nFinancial entities shall report at least yearly to the competent authorities on the number of new arrangements on the use of ICT services, the categories of ICT third-party service providers, the type of contractual arrangements and the ICT services and functions which are being provided.\n\nFinancial entities shall make available to the competent authority, upon its request, the full register of information or, as requested, specified sections thereof, along with any information deemed necessary to enable the effective supervision of the financial entity.\n\nFinancial entities shall inform the competent authority in a timely manner about any planned contractual arrangement on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions as well as when a function has become critical or important.\n\n4. Before entering into a contractual arrangement on the use of ICT services, financial entities shall:\n\n- (a) assess whether the contractual arrangement covers the use of ICT services supporting a critical or important function;\n- (b) assess if supervisory conditions for contracting are met;\n- (c) identify and assess all relevant risks in relation to the contractual arrangement, including the possibility that such contractual arrangement may contribute to reinforcing ICT concentration risk as referred to in Article 29;\n- (d) undertake all due diligence on prospective ICT third-party service providers and ensure throughout the selection and assessment processes that the ICT third-party service provider is suitable;\n- (e) identify and assess conflicts of interest that the contractual arrangement may cause.\n5. Financial entities may only enter into contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers that comply with appropriate information security standards. When those contractual arrangements concern critical or important functions, financial entities shall, prior to concluding the arrangements, take due consideration of the use, by ICT third-party service providers, of the most up-to-date and highest quality information security standards.\n\n6. In exercising access, inspection and audit rights over the ICT third-party service provider, financial entities shall, on the basis of a risk-based approach, pre-determine the frequency of audits and inspections as well as the areas to be audited through adhering to commonly accepted audit standards in line with any supervisory instruction on the use and incorporation of such audit standards.\n\nWhere contractual arrangements concluded with ICT third-party service providers on the use of ICT services entail high technical complexity, the financial entity shall verify that auditors, whether internal or external, or a pool of auditors, possess appropriate skills and knowledge to effectively perform the relevant audits and assessments.\n\n7. Financial entities shall ensure that contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services may be terminated in any of the following circumstances:\n\n- (a) significant breach by the ICT third-party service provider of applicable laws, regulations or contractual terms;\n- (b) circumstances identified throughout the monitoring of ICT third-party risk that are deemed capable of altering the performance of the functions provided through the contractual arrangement, including material changes that affect the arrangement or the situation of the ICT third-party service provider;\n- (c) ICT third-party service provider’s evidenced weaknesses pertaining to its overall ICT risk management and in particular in the way it ensures the availability, authenticity, integrity and, confidentiality, of data, whether personal or otherwise sensitive data, or non-personal data;\n- (d) where the competent authority can no longer effectively supervise the financial entity as a result of the conditions of, or circumstances related to, the respective contractual arrangement.\n8. For ICT services supporting critical or important functions, financial entities shall put in place exit strategies. The exit strategies shall take into account risks that may emerge at the level of ICT third-party service providers, in particular a possible failure on their part, a deterioration of the quality of the ICT services provided, any business disruption due to inappropriate or failed provision of ICT services or any material risk arising in relation to the appropriate and continuous deployment of the respective ICT service, or the termination of contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers under any of the circumstances listed in paragraph 7.\n\nFinancial entities shall ensure that they are able to exit contractual arrangements without:\n\n- (a) disruption to their business activities,\n- (b) limiting compliance with regulatory requirements,\n- (c) detriment to the continuity and quality of services provided to clients.\nExit plans shall be comprehensive, documented and, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 4(2), shall be sufficiently tested and reviewed periodically.\n\nFinancial entities shall identify alternative solutions and develop transition plans enabling them to remove the contracted ICT services and the relevant data from the ICT third-party service provider and to securely and integrally transfer them to alternative providers or reincorporate them in-house.\n\nFinancial entities shall have appropriate contingency measures in place to maintain business continuity in the event of the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph.\n\n9. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft implementing technical standards to establish the standard templates for the purposes of the register of information referred to in paragraph 3, including information that is common to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services. The ESAs shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024.\n\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n10. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the detailed content of the policy referred to in paragraph 2 in relation to the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provided by ICT third-party service providers.\n\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into account the size and the overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations. The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n### Article 29\n\n**Preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level**\n\n1. When performing the identification and assessment of risks referred to in Article 28(4), point (c), financial entities shall also take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of the following:\n\n- (a) contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable; or\n- (b) having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services supporting critical or important functions with the same ICT third-party service provider or with closely connected ICT third-party service providers.\nFinancial entities shall weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, such as the use of different ICT third-party service providers, taking into account if and how envisaged solutions match the business needs and objectives set out in their digital resilience strategy.\n\n2. Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions include the possibility that an ICT third-party service provider further subcontracts ICT services supporting a critical or important function to other ICT third-party service providers, financial entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in connection with such subcontracting, in particular in the case of an ICT subcontractor established in a third-country.\n\nWhere contractual arrangements concern ICT services supporting critical or important functions, financial entities shall duly consider the insolvency law provisions that would apply in the event of the ICT third-party service provider’s bankruptcy as well as any constraint that may arise in respect to the urgent recovery of the financial entity’s data.\n\nWhere contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions are concluded with an ICT third-party service provider established in a third country, financial entities shall, in addition to the considerations referred to in the second subparagraph, also consider the compliance with Union data protection rules and the effective enforcement of the law in that third country.\n\nWhere the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provide for subcontracting, financial entities shall assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of subcontracting may impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity in that respect.\n\n### Article 30\n\n**Key contractual provisions**\n\n1. The rights and obligations of the financial entity and of the ICT third-party service provider shall be clearly allocated and set out in writing. The full contract shall include the service level agreements and be documented in one written document which shall be available to the parties on paper, or in a document with another downloadable, durable and accessible format.\n\n2. The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services shall include at least the following elements:\n\n- (a) a clear and complete description of all functions and ICT services to be provided by the ICT third-party service provider, indicating whether subcontracting of an ICT service supporting a critical or important function, or material parts thereof, is permitted and, when that is the case, the conditions applying to such subcontracting;\n- (b) the locations, namely the regions or countries, where the contracted or subcontracted functions and ICT services are to be provided and where data is to be processed, including the storage location, and the requirement for the ICT third-party service provider to notify the financial entity in advance if it envisages changing such locations;\n- (c) provisions on availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality in relation to the protection of data, including personal data;\n- (d) provisions on ensuring access, recovery and return in an easily accessible format of personal and non-personal data processed by the financial entity in the event of the insolvency, resolution or discontinuation of the business operations of the ICT third-party service provider, or in the event of the termination of the contractual arrangements;\n- (e) service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof;\n- (f) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to provide assistance to the financial entity at no additional cost, or at a cost that is determined ex-ante, when an ICT incident that is related to the ICT service provided to the financial entity occurs;\n- (g) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate with the competent authorities and the resolution authorities of the financial entity, including persons appointed by them;\n- (h) termination rights and related minimum notice periods for the termination of the contractual arrangements, in accordance with the expectations of competent authorities and resolution authorities;\n- (i) the conditions for the participation of ICT third-party service providers in the financial entities’ ICT security awareness programmes and digital operational resilience training in accordance with Article 13(6).\n3. The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions shall include, in addition to the elements referred to in paragraph 2, at least the following:\n\n- (a) full service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof with precise quantitative and qualitative performance targets within the agreed service levels to allow effective monitoring by the financial entity of ICT services and enable appropriate corrective actions to be taken, without undue delay, when agreed service levels are not met;\n- (b) notice periods and reporting obligations of the ICT third-party service provider to the financial entity, including notification of any development that might have a material impact on the ICT third-party service provider’s ability to effectively provide the ICT services supporting critical or important functions in line with agreed service levels;\n- (c) requirements for the ICT third-party service provider to implement and test business contingency plans and to have in place ICT security measures, tools and policies that provide an appropriate level of security for the provision of services by the financial entity in line with its regulatory framework;\n- (d) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to participate and fully cooperate in the financial entity’s TLPT as referred to in Articles 26 and 27;\n- (e) the right to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the ICT third-party service provider’s performance, which entails the following:\n- (i) unrestricted rights of access, inspection and audit by the financial entity, or an appointed third party, and by the competent authority, and the right to take copies of relevant documentation on-site if they are critical to the operations of the ICT third-party service provider, the effective exercise of which is not impeded or limited by other contractual arrangements or implementation policies;\n   - (ii) the right to agree on alternative assurance levels if other clients’ rights are affected;\n\n   - (iii) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate during the onsite inspections and audits performed by the competent authorities, the Lead Overseer, financial entity or an appointed third party; and\n\n   - (iv) the obligation to provide details on the scope, procedures to be followed and frequency of such inspections and audits;\n\n- (f) exit strategies, in particular the establishment of a mandatory adequate transition period:\n- (i) during which the ICT third-party service provider will continue providing the respective functions, or ICT services, with a view to reducing the risk of disruption at the financial entity or to ensure its effective resolution and restructuring;\n   - (ii) allowing the financial entity to migrate to another ICT third-party service provider or change to in-house solutions consistent with the complexity of the service provided.\n\nBy way of derogation from point (e), the ICT third-party service provider and the financial entity that is a microenterprise may agree that the financial entity’s rights of access, inspection and audit can be delegated to an independent third party, appointed by the ICT third-party service provider, and that the financial entity is able to request information and assurance on the ICT third-party service provider’s performance from the third party at any time.\n\n4. When negotiating contractual arrangements, financial entities and ICT third-party service providers shall consider the use of standard contractual clauses developed by public authorities for specific services.\n\n5. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the elements referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), which a financial entity needs to determine and assess when subcontracting ICT services supporting critical or important functions.\n\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into consideration the size and overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations.\n\nThe ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n### Section II — Oversight Framework of critical ICT third-party service providers\n\n### Article 31\n\n**Designation of critical ICT third-party service providers**\n\n1. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee and upon recommendation from the Oversight Forum established pursuant to Article 32(1), shall:\n\n- (a) designate the ICT third-party service providers that are critical for financial entities, following an assessment that takes into account the criteria specified in paragraph 2;\n- (b) appoint as Lead Overseer for each critical ICT third-party service provider the ESA that is responsible, in accordance with Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 or (EU) No 1095/2010, for the financial entities having together the largest share of total assets out of the value of total assets of all financial entities using the services of the relevant critical ICT third-party service provider, as evidenced by the sum of the individual balance sheets of those financial entities.\n2. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall be based on all of the following criteria in relation to ICT services provided by the ICT third-party service provider:\n\n- (a) the systemic impact on the stability, continuity or quality of the provision of financial services in the event that the relevant ICT third-party service provider would face a large scale operational failure to provide its services, taking into account the number of financial entities and the total value of assets of financial entities to which the relevant ICT third-party service provider provides services;\n- (b) the systemic character or importance of the financial entities that rely on the relevant ICT third-party service provider, assessed in accordance with the following parameters:\n- (i) the number of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) that rely on the respective ICT third-party service provider;\n   - (ii) the interdependence between the G-SIIs or O-SIIs referred to in point (i) and other financial entities, including situations where the G-SIIs or O-SIIs provide financial infrastructure services to other financial entities;\n\n- (c) the reliance of financial entities on the services provided by the relevant ICT third-party service provider in relation to critical or important functions of financial entities that ultimately involve the same ICT third-party service provider, irrespective of whether financial entities rely on those services directly or indirectly, through subcontracting arrangements;\n- (d) the degree of substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, taking into account the following parameters:\n- (i) the lack of real alternatives, even partial, due to the limited number of ICT third-party service providers active on a specific market, or the market share of the relevant ICT third-party service provider, or the technical complexity or sophistication involved, including in relation to any proprietary technology, or the specific features of the ICT third-party service provider’s organisation or activity;\n   - (ii) difficulties in relation to partially or fully migrating the relevant data and workloads from the relevant ICT third-party service provider to another ICT third-party service provider, due either to significant financial costs, time or other resources that the migration process may entail, or to increased ICT risk or other operational risks to which the financial entity may be exposed through such migration.\n\n3. Where the ICT third-party service provider belongs to a group, the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 shall be considered in relation to the ICT services provided by the group as a whole.\n\n4. Critical ICT third-party service providers which are part of a group shall designate one legal person as a coordination point to ensure adequate representation and communication with the Lead Overseer.\n\n5. The Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of the outcome of the assessment leading to the designation referred in paragraph 1, point (a). Within 6 weeks from the date of the notification, the ICT third-party service provider may submit to the Lead Overseer a reasoned statement with any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment. The Lead Overseer shall consider the reasoned statement and may request additional information to be submitted within 30 calendar days of the receipt of such statement.\n\nAfter designating an ICT third-party service provider as critical, the ESAs, through the Joint Committee, shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of such designation and the starting date as from which they will effectively be subject to oversight activities. That starting date shall be no later than one month after the notification. The ICT third-party service provider shall notify the financial entities to which they provide services of their designation as critical.\n\n6.

The Lead Overseer, appointed in accordance with Article 31(1), point (b), shall conduct the oversight of the assigned critical ICT third-party service providers and shall be, for the purposes of all matters related to the oversight, the primary point of contact for those critical ICT third-party service providers.\n\n2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseer shall assess whether each critical ICT third-party service provider has in place comprehensive, sound and effective rules, procedures, mechanisms and arrangements to manage the ICT risk which it may pose to financial entities.\n\nThe assessment referred to in the first subparagraph shall focus mainly on ICT services provided by the critical ICT third-party service provider supporting the critical or important functions of financial entities. Where necessary to address all relevant risks, that assessment shall extend to ICT services supporting functions other than those that are critical or important.\n\n3. The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover:\n\n- (a) ICT requirements to ensure, in particular, the security, availability, continuity, scalability and quality of services which the critical ICT third-party service provider provides to financial entities, as well as the ability to maintain at all times high standards of availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data;\n- (b) the physical security contributing to ensuring the ICT security, including the security of premises, facilities, data centres;\n- (c) the risk management processes, including ICT risk management policies, ICT business continuity policy and ICT response and recovery plans;\n- (d) the governance arrangements, including an organisational structure with clear, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility and accountability rules enabling effective ICT risk management;\n- (e) the identification, monitoring and prompt reporting of material ICT-related incidents to financial entities, the management and resolution of those incidents, in particular cyber-attacks;\n- (f) the mechanisms for data portability, application portability and interoperability, which ensure an effective exercise of termination rights by the financial entities;\n- (g) the testing of ICT systems, infrastructure and controls;\n- (h) the ICT audits;\n- (i) the use of relevant national and international standards applicable to the provision of its ICT services to the financial entities.\n4. Based on the assessment referred to in paragraph 2, and in coordination with the Joint Oversight Network (JON) referred to in Article 34(1), the Lead Overseer shall adopt a clear, detailed and reasoned individual oversight plan describing the annual oversight objectives and the main oversight actions planned for each critical ICT third-party service provider. That plan shall be communicated yearly to the critical ICT third-party service provider.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the oversight plan, the Lead Overseer shall communicate the draft oversight plan to the critical ICT third-party service provider.\n\nUpon receipt of the draft oversight plan, the critical ICT third-party service provider may submit a reasoned statement within 15 calendar days evidencing the expected impact on customers which are entities falling outside of the scope of this Regulation and where appropriate, formulating solutions to mitigate risks.\n\n5. Once the annual oversight plans referred to in paragraph 4 have been adopted and notified to the critical ICT third-party service providers, competent authorities may take measures concerning such critical ICT third-party service providers only in agreement with the Lead Overseer.\n\n### Article 34\n\n**Operational coordination between Lead Overseers**\n\n1. To ensure a consistent approach to oversight activities and with a view to enabling coordinated general oversight strategies and cohesive operational approaches and work methodologies, the three Lead Overseers appointed in accordance with Article 31(1), point (b), shall set up a JON to coordinate among themselves in the preparatory stages and to coordinate the conduct of oversight activities over their respective overseen critical ICT third-party service providers, as well as in the course of any action that may be needed pursuant to Article 42.\n\n2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseers shall draw up a common oversight protocol specifying the detailed procedures to be followed for carrying out the day-to-day coordination and for ensuring swift exchanges and reactions. The protocol shall be periodically revised to reflect operational needs, in particular the evolution of practical oversight arrangements.\n\n3. The Lead Overseers may, on an ad-hoc basis, call on the ECB and ENISA to provide technical advice, share hands-on experience or join specific coordination meetings of the JON.\n\n### Article 35\n\n**Powers of the Lead Overseer**\n\n1. For the purposes of carrying out the duties laid down in this Section, the Lead Overseer shall have the following powers in respect of the critical ICT third-party service providers:\n\n- (a) to request all relevant information and documentation in accordance with Article 37;\n- (b) to conduct general investigations and inspections in accordance with Articles 38 and 39, respectively;\n- (c) to request, after the completion of the oversight activities, reports specifying the actions that have been taken or the remedies that have been implemented by the critical ICT third-party service providers in relation to the recommendations referred to in point (d) of this paragraph;\n- (d) to issue recommendations on the areas referred to in Article 33(3), in particular concerning the following:\n- (i) the use of specific ICT security and quality requirements or processes, in particular in relation to the roll-out of patches, updates, encryption and other security measures which the Lead Overseer deems relevant for ensuring the ICT security of services provided to financial entities;\n   - (ii) the use of conditions and terms, including their technical implementation, under which the critical ICT third-party service providers provide ICT services to financial entities, which the Lead Overseer deems relevant for preventing the generation of single points of failure, the amplification thereof, or for minimising the possible systemic impact across the Union’s financial sector in the event of ICT concentration risk;\n\n   - (iii) any planned subcontracting, where the Lead Overseer deems that further subcontracting, including subcontracting arrangements which the critical ICT third-party service providers plan to enter into with ICT third-party service providers or with ICT subcontractors established in a third country, may trigger risks for the provision of services by the financial entity, or risks to the financial stability, based on the examination of the information gathered in accordance with Articles 37 and 38;\n\n   - (iv) refraining from entering into a further subcontracting arrangement, where the following cumulative conditions are met:\n\n—\n\nthe envisaged subcontractor is an ICT third-party service provider or an ICT subcontractor established in a third country;\n\n—\n\nthe subcontracting concerns critical or important functions of the financial entity; and\n\n—\n\nthe Lead Overseer deems that the use of such subcontracting poses a clear and serious risk to the financial stability of the Union or to financial entities, including to the ability of financial entities to comply with supervisory requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of point (iv) of this point, ICT third-party service providers shall, using the template referred to in Article 41(1), point (b), transmit the information regarding subcontracting to the Lead Overseer.\n\n2. When exercising the powers referred to in this Article, the Lead Overseer shall:\n\n- (a) ensure regular coordination within the JON, and in particular shall seek consistent approaches, as appropriate, with regard to the oversight of critical ICT third-party service providers;\n- (b) take due account of the framework established by Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and, where necessary, consult the relevant competent authorities designated or established in accordance with that Directive, in order to avoid duplication of technical and organisational measures that might apply to critical ICT third-party service providers pursuant to that Directive;\n- (c) seek to minimise, to the extent possible, the risk of disruption to services provided by critical ICT third-party service providers to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation.\n3. The Lead Overseer shall consult the Oversight Forum before exercising the powers referred to in paragraph 1.\n\nBefore issuing recommendations in accordance with paragraph 1, point (d), the Lead Overseer shall give the opportunity to the ICT third-party service provider to provide, within 30 calendar days, relevant information evidencing the expected impact on customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation and, where appropriate, formulating solutions to mitigate risks.\n\n4. The Lead Overseer shall inform the JON of the outcome of the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b). The Lead Overseer shall, without undue delay, transmit the reports referred to in paragraph 1, point (c), to the JON and to the competent authorities of the financial entities using the ICT services of that critical ICT third-party service provider.\n\n5. Critical ICT third-party service providers shall cooperate in good faith with the Lead Overseer, and assist it in the fulfilment of its tasks.\n\n6. In the event of whole or partial non-compliance with the measures required to be taken pursuant to the exercise of the powers under paragraph 1, points (a), (b) and (c), and after the expiry of a period of at least 30 calendar days from the date on which the critical ICT third-party service provider received notification of the respective measures, the Lead Overseer shall adopt a decision imposing a periodic penalty payment to compel the critical ICT third-party service provider to comply with those measures.\n\n7. The periodic penalty payment referred to in paragraph 6 shall be imposed on a daily basis until compliance is achieved and for no more than a period of six months following the notification of the decision to impose a periodic penalty payment to the critical ICT third-party service provider.\n\n8. The amount of the periodic penalty payment, calculated from the date stipulated in the decision imposing the periodic penalty payment, shall be up to 1 % of the average daily worldwide turnover of the critical ICT third-party service provider in the preceding business year. When determining the amount of the penalty payment, the Lead Overseer shall take into account the following criteria regarding non-compliance with the measures referred to in paragraph 6:\n\n- (a) the gravity and the duration of non-compliance;\n- (b) whether non-compliance has been committed intentionally or negligently;\n- (c) the level of cooperation of the ICT third-party service provider with the Lead Overseer.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, in order to ensure a consistent approach, the Lead Overseer shall engage in consultation within the JON.\n\n9. Penalty payments shall be of an administrative nature and shall be enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in the Member State on the territory of which inspections and access shall be carried out. Courts of the Member State concerned shall have jurisdiction over complaints related to irregular conduct of enforcement. The amounts of the penalty payments shall be allocated to the general budget of the European Union.\n\n10. The Lead Overseer shall disclose to the public every periodic penalty payment that has been imposed, unless such disclosure would seriously jeopardise the financial markets or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved.\n\n11. Before imposing a periodic penalty payment under paragraph 6, the Lead Overseer shall give the representatives of the critical ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings the opportunity to be heard on the findings and shall base its decisions only on findings on which the critical ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings has had an opportunity to comment.\n\nThe rights of the defence of the persons subject to the proceedings shall be fully respected in the proceedings. The critical ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings shall be entitled to have access to the file, subject to the legitimate interest of other persons in the protection of their business secrets. The right of access to the file shall not extend to confidential information or to the Lead Overseer’s internal preparatory documents.\n\n### Article 36\n\n**Exercise of the powers of the Lead Overseer outside the Union**\n\n1. When oversight objectives cannot be attained by means of interacting with the subsidiary set up for the purpose of Article 31(12), or by exercising oversight activities on premises located in the Union, the Lead Overseer may exercise the powers, referred to in the following provisions, on any premises located in a third-country which is owned, or used in any way, for the purposes of providing services to Union financial entities, by a critical ICT third-party service provider, in connection with its business operations, functions or services, including any administrative, business or operational offices, premises, lands, buildings or other properties:\n\n- (a) in Article 35(1), point (a); and\n- (b) in Article 35(1), point (b), in accordance with Article 38(2), points (a), (b) and (d), and in Article 39(1) and (2), point (a).\nThe powers referred to in the first subparagraph may be exercised subject to all of the following conditions:\n\n- (i) the conduct of an inspection in a third-country is deemed necessary by the Lead Overseer to allow it to fully and effectively perform its duties under this Regulation;\n   - (ii) the inspection in a third-country is directly related to the provision of ICT services to financial entities in the Union;\n\n   - (iii) the critical ICT third-party service provider concerned consents to the conduct of an inspection in a third-country; and\n\n   - (iv) the relevant authority of the third-country concerned has been officially notified by the Lead Overseer and raised no objection thereto.\n\n2. Without prejudice to the respective competences of the Union institutions and of Member States, for the purposes of paragraph 1, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA shall conclude administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant authority of the third country in order to enable the smooth conduct of inspections in the third country concerned by the Lead Overseer and its designated team for its mission in that third country. Those cooperation arrangements shall not create legal obligations in respect of the Union and its Member States nor shall they prevent Member States and their competent authorities from concluding bilateral or multilateral arrangements with those third countries and their relevant authorities.\n\nThose cooperation arrangements shall specify at least the following elements:\n\n- (a) the procedures for the coordination of oversight activities carried out under this Regulation and any analogous monitoring of ICT third-party risk in the financial sector exercised by the relevant authority of the third country concerned, including details for transmitting the agreement of the latter to allow the conduct, by the Lead Overseer and its designated team, of general investigations and on-site inspections as referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, on the territory under its jurisdiction;\n- (b) the mechanism for the transmission of any relevant information between EBA, ESMA or EIOPA and the relevant authority of the third country concerned, in particular in connection with information that may be requested by the Lead Overseer pursuant to Article 37;\n- (c) the mechanisms for the prompt notification by the relevant authority of the third-country concerned to EBA, ESMA or EIOPA of cases where an ICT third-party service provider established in a third country and designated as critical in accordance with Article 31(1), point (a), is deemed to have infringed the requirements to which it is obliged to adhere pursuant to the applicable law of the third country concerned when providing services to financial institutions in that third country, as well as the remedies and penalties applied;\n- (d) the regular transmission of updates on regulatory or supervisory developments on the monitoring of ICT third-party risk of financial institutions in the third country concerned;\n- (e) the details for allowing, if needed, the participation of one representative of the relevant third-country authority in the inspections conducted by the Lead Overseer and the designated team.\n3. When the Lead Overseer is not able to conduct oversight activities outside the Union, referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Lead Overseer shall:\n\n- (a) exercise its powers under Article 35 on the basis of all facts and documents available to it;\n- (b) document and explain any consequence of its inability to conduct the envisaged oversight activities as referred to in this Article.\nThe potential consequences referred to in point (b) of this paragraph shall be taken into consideration in the Lead Overseer’s recommendations issued pursuant to Article 35(1), point (d).\n\n### Article 37\n\n**Request for information**\n\n1.

Such information shall be limited to what is relevant and proportionate for the purpose of ensuring public awareness, unless such publication would cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved or could seriously jeopardise the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system of the Union.\n\nThe Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of that public disclosure.\n\n3. Competent authorities shall inform the relevant financial entities of the risks identified in the recommendations addressed to critical ICT third-party service providers in accordance with Article 35(1), point (d).\n\nWhen managing ICT third-party risk, financial entities shall take into account the risks referred to in the first subparagraph.\n\n4. Where a competent authority deems that a financial entity fails to take into account or to sufficiently address within its management of ICT third-party risk the specific risks identified in the recommendations, it shall notify the financial entity of the possibility of a decision being taken, within 60 calendar days of the receipt of such notification, pursuant to paragraph 6, in the absence of appropriate contractual arrangements aiming to address such risks.\n\n5. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c), and prior to taking a decision as referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article, competent authorities may, on a voluntary basis, consult the competent authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity subject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-party service provider.\n\n6. Competent authorities may, as a measure of last resort, following the notification and, if appropriate, the consultation as set out in paragraph 4 and 5 of this Article, in accordance with Article 50, take a decision requiring financial entities to temporarily suspend, either in part or completely, the use or deployment of a service provided by the critical ICT third-party service provider until the risks identified in the recommendations addressed to critical ICT third-party service providers have been addressed. Where necessary, they may require financial entities to terminate, in part or completely, the relevant contractual arrangements concluded with the critical ICT third-party service providers.\n\n7. Where a critical ICT third-party service provider refuses to endorse recommendations, based on a divergent approach from the one advised by the Lead Overseer, and such a divergent approach may adversely impact a large number of financial entities, or a significant part of the financial sector, and individual warnings issued by competent authorities have not resulted in consistent approaches mitigating the potential risk to financial stability, the Lead Overseer may, after consulting the Oversight Forum, issue non-binding and non-public opinions to competent authorities, in order to promote consistent and convergent supervisory follow-up measures, as appropriate.\n\n8. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c), competent authorities, when taking a decision as referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article, shall take into account the type and magnitude of risk that is not addressed by the critical ICT third-party service provider, as well as the seriousness of the non-compliance, having regard to the following criteria:\n\n- (a) the gravity and the duration of the non-compliance;\n- (b) whether the non-compliance has revealed serious weaknesses in the critical ICT third-party service provider’s procedures, management systems, risk management and internal controls;\n- (c) whether a financial crime was facilitated, occasioned or is otherwise attributable to the non-compliance;\n- (d) whether the non-compliance has been intentional or negligent;\n- (e) whether the suspension or termination of the contractual arrangements introduces a risk for continuity of the financial entity’s business operations notwithstanding the financial entity’s efforts to avoid disruption in the provision of its services;\n- (f) where applicable, the opinion of the competent authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity subject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-party service provider, requested on a voluntary basis in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article.\nCompetent authorities shall grant financial entities the necessary period of time to enable them to adjust the contractual arrangements with critical ICT third-party service providers in order to avoid detrimental effects on their digital operational resilience and to allow them to deploy exit strategies and transition plans as referred to in Article 28.\n\n9. The decision referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article shall be notified to the members of the Oversight Forum referred to in Article 32(4), points (a), (b) and (c), and to the JON.\n\nThe critical ICT third-party service providers affected by the decisions provided for in paragraph 6 shall fully cooperate with the financial entities impacted, in particular in the context of the process of suspension or termination of their contractual arrangements.\n\n10. Competent authorities shall regularly inform the Lead Overseer on the approaches and measures taken in their supervisory tasks in relation to financial entities as well as on the contractual arrangements concluded by financial entities where critical ICT third-party service providers have not endorsed in part or entirely recommendations addressed to them by the Lead Overseer.\n\n11. The Lead Overseer may, upon request, provide further clarifications on the recommendations issued to guide the competent authorities on the follow-up measures.\n\n### Article 43\n\n**Oversight fees**\n\n1. The Lead Overseer shall, in accordance with the delegated act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, charge critical ICT third-party service providers fees that fully cover the Lead Overseer’s necessary expenditure in relation to the conduct of oversight tasks pursuant to this Regulation, including the reimbursement of any costs which may be incurred as a result of work carried out by the joint examination team referred to in Article 40, as well as the costs of advice provided by the independent experts as referred to in Article 32(4), second subparagraph, in relation to matters falling under the remit of direct oversight activities.\n\nThe amount of a fee charged to a critical ICT third-party service provider shall cover all costs derived from the execution of the duties set out in this Section and shall be proportionate to its turnover.\n\n2. The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 57 to supplement this Regulation by determining the amount of the fees and the way in which they are to be paid by 17 July 2024.\n\n### Article 44\n\n**International cooperation**\n\n1. Without prejudice to Article 36, EBA, ESMA and EIOPA may, in accordance with Article 33 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1095/2010 and (EU) No 1094/2010, respectively, conclude administrative arrangements with third-country regulatory and supervisory authorities to foster international cooperation on ICT third-party risk across different financial sectors, in particular by developing best practices for the review of ICT risk management practices and controls, mitigation measures and incident responses.\n\n2. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, submit every five years a joint confidential report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission, summarising the findings of relevant discussions held with the third countries’ authorities referred to in paragraph 1, focusing on the evolution of ICT third-party risk and the implications for financial stability, market integrity, investor protection and the functioning of the internal market.\n\n## VI. Information-sharing Arrangements\n\n### Article 45\n\n**Information-sharing arrangements on cyber threat information and intelligence**\n\n1. Financial entities may exchange amongst themselves cyber threat information and intelligence, including indicators of compromise, tactics, techniques, and procedures, cyber security alerts and configuration tools, to the extent that such information and intelligence sharing:\n\n- (a) aims to enhance the digital operational resilience of financial entities, in particular through raising awareness in relation to cyber threats, limiting or impeding the cyber threats’ ability to spread, supporting defence capabilities, threat detection techniques, mitigation strategies or response and recovery stages;\n- (b) takes places within trusted communities of financial entities;\n- (c) is implemented through information-sharing arrangements that protect the potentially sensitive nature of the information shared, and that are governed by rules of conduct in full respect of business confidentiality, protection of personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and guidelines on competition policy.\n2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, point (c), the information-sharing arrangements shall define the conditions for participation and, where appropriate, shall set out the details on the involvement of public authorities and the capacity in which they may be associated to the information-sharing arrangements, on the involvement of ICT third-party service providers, and on operational elements, including the use of dedicated IT platforms.\n\n3. Financial entities shall notify competent authorities of their participation in the information-sharing arrangements referred to in paragraph 1, upon validation of their membership, or, as applicable, of the cessation of their membership, once it takes effect.\n\n## VII.

Where a competent authority publishes a decision imposing an administrative penalty against which there is an appeal before the relevant judicial authorities, competent authorities shall immediately add on their official website that information and, at later stages, any subsequent related information on the outcome of such appeal.

It keeps our economies running in key sectors, including the financial sector, and enhances the functioning of the internal market. Increased digitalisation and interconnectedness also amplify <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span>, making society as a whole, and the financial system in particular, more vulnerable to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span> or ICT disruptions. While the ubiquitous use of ICT systems and high digitalisation and connectivity are today core features of the activities of Union financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, their digital resilience has yet to be better addressed and integrated into their broader operational frameworks.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-2\" data-recital=\"2\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(2) The use of ICT has in the past decades gained a pivotal role in the provision of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, to the point where it has now acquired a critical importance in the operation of typical daily functions of all financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>. Digitalisation now covers, for instance, payments, which have increasingly moved from cash and paper-based methods to the use of digital solutions, as well as securities clearing and settlement, electronic and algorithmic trading, lending and funding operations, peer-to-peer finance, credit rating, claim management and back-office operations. The insurance sector has also been transformed by the use of ICT, from the emergence of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"insurance-intermediary\" tabindex=\"0\">insurance intermediaries</span> offering their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> online operating with InsurTech, to digital insurance underwriting. Finance has not only become largely digital throughout the whole sector, but digitalisation has also deepened interconnections and dependencies within the financial sector and with third-party infrastructure and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">service</span> providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-3\" data-recital=\"3\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(3) The European Systemic <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">Risk</span> Board (ESRB) reaffirmed in a 2020 report addressing systemic cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> how the existing high level of interconnectedness across financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, financial markets and financial market infrastructures, and particularly the interdependencies of their ICT systems, could constitute a systemic <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"vulnerability\" tabindex=\"0\">vulnerability</span> because localised cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> could quickly spread from any of the approximately 22 000 Union financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to the entire financial system, unhindered by geographical boundaries. Serious ICT breaches that occur in the financial sector do not merely affect financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> taken in isolation. They also smooth the way for the propagation of localised <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"vulnerability\" tabindex=\"0\">vulnerabilities</span> across the financial transmission channels and potentially trigger adverse consequences for the stability of the Union’s financial system, such as generating liquidity runs and an overall loss of confidence and trust in financial markets.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-4\" data-recital=\"4\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(4) In recent years, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> has attracted the attention of international, Union and national policy makers, regulators and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standard</span>-setting bodies in an attempt to enhance digital resilience, set <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> and coordinate regulatory or supervisory work. At international level, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, the Financial Stability Board, the Financial Stability Institute, as well as the G7 and G20 aim to provide competent authorities and market operators across various jurisdictions with tools to bolster the resilience of their financial systems. That work has also been driven by the need to duly consider <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> in the context of a highly interconnected global financial system and to seek more consistency of relevant best practices.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-5\" data-recital=\"5\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(5) Despite Union and national targeted policy and legislative initiatives, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> continues to pose a challenge to the operational resilience, performance and stability of the Union financial system. The reforms that followed the 2008 financial crisis primarily strengthened the financial resilience of the Union financial sector and aimed to safeguard the competitiveness and stability of the Union from economic, prudential and market conduct perspectives. Although ICT security and digital resilience are part of operational <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, they have been less in the focus of the post-financial crisis regulatory agenda and have developed in only some areas of the Union’s financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> policy and regulatory landscape, or in only a few Member States.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-6\" data-recital=\"6\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(6) In its <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"communication\" tabindex=\"0\">Communication</span> of 8 March 2018 entitled ‘FinTech Action plan: For a more competitive and innovative European financial sector’, the Commission highlighted the paramount importance of making the Union financial sector more resilient, including from an operational perspective to ensure its technological safety and good functioning, its quick recovery from ICT breaches and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span>, ultimately enabling the effective and smooth provision of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> across the whole Union, including under situations of stress, while also preserving consumer and market trust and confidence.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-7\" data-recital=\"7\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(7) In April 2019, the European <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"supervisory-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">Supervisory Authority</span> (European Banking Authority), (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the European <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"supervisory-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">Supervisory Authority</span> (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), (‘EIOPA’) established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and the European <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"supervisory-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">Supervisory Authority</span> (European Securities and Markets Authority), (‘ESMA’) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) (known collectively as ‘European <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"supervisory-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">Supervisory Authorities</span>’ or ‘ESAs’) jointly issued technical advice calling for a coherent approach to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> in finance and recommending to strengthen, in a proportionate way, the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> of the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> industry through a sector-specific initiative of the Union.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-8\" data-recital=\"8\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(8) The Union financial sector is regulated by a Single Rulebook and governed by a European system of financial supervision. Nonetheless, provisions tackling <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> and ICT security are not yet fully or consistently harmonised, despite <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> being vital for ensuring financial stability and market integrity in the digital age, and no less important than, for example, common prudential or market conduct <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span>. The Single Rulebook and system of supervision should therefore be developed to also cover <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span>, by strengthening the mandates of competent authorities to enable them to supervise the management of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> in the financial sector in order to protect the integrity and efficiency of the internal market, and to facilitate its orderly functioning.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-9\" data-recital=\"9\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(9) Legislative disparities and uneven national regulatory or supervisory approaches with regard to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> trigger obstacles to the functioning of the internal market in financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, impeding the smooth exercise of the freedom of establishment and the provision of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> for financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> operating on a cross-border basis. Competition between the same type of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> operating in different Member States could also be distorted. This is the case, in particular, for areas where Union harmonisation has been very limited, such as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing, or absent, such as the monitoring of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span>. Disparities stemming from developments envisaged at national level could generate further obstacles to the functioning of the internal market to the detriment of market participants and financial stability.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-10\" data-recital=\"10\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(10) To date, due to the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> related provisions being only partially addressed at Union level, there are gaps or overlaps in important areas, such as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing, and inconsistencies as a result of emerging divergent national rules or cost-ineffective application of overlapping rules. This is particularly detrimental for an ICT-intensive <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"user\" tabindex=\"0\">user</span> such as the financial sector since technology <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> have no borders and the financial sector deploys its <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> on a wide cross-border basis within and outside the Union. Individual financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> operating on a cross-border basis or holding several authorisations (e.g. one financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> can have a banking, an <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"investment-firm\" tabindex=\"0\">investment firm</span>, and a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"payment-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">payment institution</span> licence, each issued by a different competent authority in one or several Member States) face operational challenges in addressing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> and mitigating adverse impacts of ICT <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> on their own and in a coherent cost-effective way.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-11\" data-recital=\"11\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(11) As the Single Rulebook has not been accompanied by a comprehensive ICT or operational <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> framework, further harmonisation of key <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> requirements for all financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> is required. The development of ICT capabilities and overall resilience by financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, based on those key requirements, with a view to withstanding operational outages, would help preserve the stability and integrity of the Union financial markets and thus contribute to ensuring a high level of protection of investors and consumers in the Union. Since this Regulation aims to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, it should be based on the provisions of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice).</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-12\" data-recital=\"12\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(12) This Regulation aims to consolidate and upgrade <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> requirements as part of the operational <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> requirements that have, up to this point, been addressed separately in various Union legal acts. While those acts covered the main categories of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> (e.g. credit <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, market <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, counterparty credit <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> and liquidity <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, market conduct <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>), they did not comprehensively tackle, at the time of their adoption, all components of operational resilience. The operational <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> rules, when further developed in those Union legal acts, often favoured a traditional quantitative approach to addressing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> (namely setting a capital requirement to cover <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span>) rather than targeted qualitative rules for the protection, detection, containment, recovery and repair capabilities against <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incidents</span>, or for reporting and digital testing capabilities. Those acts were primarily meant to cover and update essential rules on prudential supervision, market integrity or conduct. By consolidating and upgrading the different rules on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span>, all provisions addressing digital <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> in the financial sector should for the first time be brought together in a consistent manner in one single legislative act. Therefore, this Regulation fills in the gaps or remedies inconsistencies in some of the prior legal acts, including in relation to the terminology used therein, and explicitly refers to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> via targeted rules on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span>-management capabilities, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incident</span> reporting, operational resilience testing and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span> monitoring. This Regulation should thus also raise awareness of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> and acknowledge that ICT <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> and a lack of operational resilience have the possibility to jeopardise the soundness of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-13\" data-recital=\"13\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(13) Financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should follow the same approach and the same principle-based rules when addressing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> taking into account their size and overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, activities and operations. Consistency contributes to enhancing confidence in the financial system and preserving its stability especially in times of high reliance on ICT systems, platforms and infrastructures, which entails increased digital <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>. Observing basic cyber hygiene should also avoid imposing heavy costs on the economy by minimising the impact and costs of ICT disruptions.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-14\" data-recital=\"14\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(14) A Regulation helps reduce regulatory complexity, fosters supervisory convergence and increases legal certainty, and also contributes to limiting compliance costs, especially for financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> operating across borders, and to reducing competitive distortions. Therefore, the choice of a Regulation for the establishment of a common framework for the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> is the most appropriate way to guarantee a homogenous and coherent application of all components of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management by the Union financial sector.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-15\" data-recital=\"15\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(15) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) was the first horizontal <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cybersecurity\" tabindex=\"0\">cybersecurity</span> framework enacted at Union level, applying also to three types of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, namely <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"credit-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">credit institutions</span>, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"trading-venue\" tabindex=\"0\">trading venues</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"central-counterparty\" tabindex=\"0\">central counterparties</span>. However, since Directive (EU) 2016/1148 set out a mechanism of identification at national level of operators of essential <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, only certain <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"credit-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">credit institutions</span>, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"trading-venue\" tabindex=\"0\">trading venues</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"central-counterparty\" tabindex=\"0\">central counterparties</span> that were identified by the Member States, have been brought into its scope in practice, and hence required to comply with the ICT security and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incident</span> notification requirements laid down in it. Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) sets a uniform criterion to determine the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> falling within its scope of application (size-cap rule) while also keeping the three types of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> in its scope.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-16\" data-recital=\"16\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(16) However, as this Regulation increases the level of harmonisation of the various digital resilience components, by introducing requirements on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting that are more stringent in comparison to those laid down in the current Union financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> law, this higher level constitutes an increased harmonisation also in comparison with the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Consequently, this Regulation constitutes lex specialis with regard to Directive (EU) 2022/2555. At the same time, it is crucial to maintain a strong relationship between the financial sector and the Union horizontal <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cybersecurity\" tabindex=\"0\">cybersecurity</span> framework as currently laid out in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 to ensure consistency with the cyber security strategies adopted by Member States and to allow financial supervisors to be made aware of cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> affecting other sectors covered by that Directive.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-17\" data-recital=\"17\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(17) In accordance with Article 4(2) of the Treaty on European Union and without prejudice to the judicial review by the Court of Justice, this Regulation should not affect the responsibility of Member States with regard to essential State functions concerning public security, defence and the safeguarding of national security, for example concerning the supply of information which would be contrary to the safeguarding of national security.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-18\" data-recital=\"18\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(18) To enable cross-sector learning and to effectively draw on experiences of other sectors in dealing with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span>, the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> referred to in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 should remain part of the ‘ecosystem’ of that Directive (for example, Cooperation <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">Group</span> and computer security <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incident</span> response teams (CSIRTs)).The ESAs and national competent authorities should be able to participate in the strategic policy discussions and the technical workings of the Cooperation <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">Group</span> under that Directive, and to exchange information and further cooperate with the single points of contact designated or established in accordance with that Directive.

Given that the physical resilience of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> is addressed in a comprehensive manner by the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management and reporting obligations covered by this Regulation, the obligations laid down in Chapters III and IV of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 should not apply to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> falling within the scope of that Directive.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-20\" data-recital=\"20\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(20) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cloud-computing-service\" tabindex=\"0\">Cloud computing service</span> providers are one category of digital infrastructure covered by Directive (EU) 2022/2555.

Moreover, the Oversight Framework established by this Regulation should cover <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cloud-computing-service\" tabindex=\"0\">cloud computing service</span> providers in the absence of a Union horizontal framework establishing a digital oversight authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-21\" data-recital=\"21\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(21) In order to maintain full control over <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span>, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> need to have comprehensive capabilities to enable a strong and effective <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management, as well as specific mechanisms and policies for handling all <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incidents</span> and for reporting <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span>. Likewise, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should have policies in place for the testing of ICT systems, controls and processes, as well as for managing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span>. The <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> baseline for financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should be increased while also allowing for a proportionate application of requirements for certain financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, particularly <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">microenterprises</span>, as well as financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> subject to a simplified <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework. To facilitate an efficient supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision that is proportionate and addresses the need to reduce administrative burdens on the competent authorities, the relevant national supervisory arrangements in respect of such financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should take into account their size and overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, activities and operations even when the relevant thresholds established in Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) are exceeded. In particular, supervisory activities should focus primarily on the need to address serious <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> associated with the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management of a particular <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-22\" data-recital=\"22\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(22) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting thresholds and taxonomies vary significantly at national level. While common ground may be achieved through the relevant work undertaken by the European Union Agency for <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cybersecurity\" tabindex=\"0\">Cybersecurity</span> (ENISA) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and the Cooperation <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">Group</span> under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, divergent approaches on setting the thresholds and use of taxonomies still exist, or can emerge, for the remainder of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>. Due to those divergences, there are multiple requirements that financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> must comply with, especially when operating across several Member States and when part of a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span>. Moreover, such divergences have the potential to hinder the creation of further uniform or centralised Union mechanisms that speed up the reporting process and support a quick and smooth exchange of information between competent authorities, which is crucial for addressing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> in the event of large-scale attacks with potentially systemic consequences.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-23\" data-recital=\"23\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(23) To reduce the administrative burden and potentially duplicative reporting obligations for certain financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, the requirement for the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incident</span> reporting pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) should cease to apply to payment <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">service</span> providers that fall within the scope of this Regulation. Consequently, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"credit-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">credit institutions</span>, e-money institutions, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"payment-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">payment institutions</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"account-information-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">account information service providers</span>, as referred to in Article 33(1) of that Directive, should, from the date of application of this Regulation, report pursuant to this Regulation, all <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"operational-or-security-payment-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">operational or security payment-related incidents</span> which have been previously reported pursuant to that Directive, irrespective of whether such <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> are ICT-related.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-24\" data-recital=\"24\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(24) To enable competent authorities to fulfil supervisory roles by acquiring a complete overview of the nature, frequency, significance and impact of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incidents</span> and to enhance the exchange of information between relevant <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"public-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">public authorities</span>, including law enforcement authorities and resolution authorities, this Regulation should lay down a robust <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting regime whereby the relevant requirements address current gaps in financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> law, and remove existing overlaps and duplications to alleviate costs. It is essential to harmonise the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting regime by requiring all financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to report to their competent authorities through a single streamlined framework as set out in this Regulation. In addition, the ESAs should be empowered to further specify relevant elements for the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting framework, such as taxonomy, timeframes, data sets, templates and applicable thresholds. To ensure full consistency with Directive (EU) 2022/2555, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should be allowed, on a voluntary basis, to notify <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"significant-cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">significant cyber threats</span> to the relevant competent authority, when they consider that the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threat</span> is of relevance to the financial system, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">service</span> <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"user\" tabindex=\"0\">users</span> or clients.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-25\" data-recital=\"25\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(25) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">Digital operational resilience</span> testing requirements have been developed in certain financial subsectors setting out frameworks that are not always fully aligned. This leads to a potential duplication of costs for cross-border financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> and makes the mutual recognition of the results of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing complex which, in turn, can fragment the internal market.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-26\" data-recital=\"26\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(26) In addition, where no ICT testing is required, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"vulnerability\" tabindex=\"0\">vulnerabilities</span> remain undetected and result in exposing a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> and ultimately create a higher <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> to the stability and integrity of the financial sector. Without Union intervention, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing would continue to be inconsistent and would lack a system of mutual recognition of ICT testing results across different jurisdictions. In addition, as it is unlikely that other financial subsectors would adopt testing schemes on a meaningful scale, they would miss out on the potential benefits of a testing framework, in terms of revealing ICT <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"vulnerability\" tabindex=\"0\">vulnerabilities</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span>, and testing defence capabilities and business continuity, which contributes to increasing the trust of customers, suppliers and business partners. To remedy those overlaps, divergences and gaps, it is necessary to lay down rules for a coordinated testing regime and thereby facilitate the mutual recognition of advanced testing for financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-27\" data-recital=\"27\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(27) Financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>’ reliance on the use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> is partly driven by their need to adapt to an emerging competitive digital global economy, to boost their business efficiency and to meet consumer demand. The nature and extent of such reliance has been continuously evolving in recent years, driving cost reduction in financial intermediation, enabling business expansion and scalability in the deployment of financial activities while offering a wide range of ICT tools to manage complex internal processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-28\" data-recital=\"28\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(28) The extensive use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> is evidenced by complex contractual arrangements, whereby financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> often encounter difficulties in negotiating contractual terms that are tailored to the prudential <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> or other regulatory requirements to which they are subject, or otherwise in enforcing specific rights, such as access or audit rights, even when the latter are enshrined in their contractual arrangements. Moreover, many of those contractual arrangements do not provide for sufficient safeguards allowing for the fully-fledged monitoring of subcontracting processes, thus depriving the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> of its ability to assess the associated <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span>. In addition, as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> often provide standardised <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> to different types of clients, such contractual arrangements do not always cater adequately for the individual or specific needs of financial industry actors.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-29\" data-recital=\"29\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(29) Even though Union financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> law contains certain general rules on outsourcing, monitoring of the contractual dimension is not fully anchored into Union law. In the absence of clear and bespoke Union <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> applying to the contractual arrangements concluded with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span>, the external source of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> is not comprehensively addressed. Consequently, it is necessary to set out certain key principles to guide financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>’ management of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span>, which are of particular importance when financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> resort to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> to support their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-or-important-function\" tabindex=\"0\">critical or important functions</span>. Those principles should be accompanied by a set of core contractual rights in relation to several elements in the performance and termination of contractual arrangements with a view to providing certain minimum safeguards in order to strengthen financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>’ ability to effectively monitor all <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> emerging at the level of third-party <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">service</span> providers. Those principles are complementary to the sectoral law applicable to outsourcing.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-30\" data-recital=\"30\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(30) A certain lack of homogeneity and convergence regarding the monitoring of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span> and ICT third-party dependencies is evident today. Despite efforts to address outsourcing, such as EBA Guidelines on outsourcing of 2019 and ESMA Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">service</span> providers of 2021 the broader issue of counteracting systemic <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> which may be triggered by the financial sector’s exposure to a limited number of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> is not sufficiently addressed by Union law. The lack of rules at Union level is compounded by the absence of national rules on mandates and tools that allow financial supervisors to acquire a good understanding of ICT third-party dependencies and to monitor adequately <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> arising from the concentration of ICT third-party dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-31\" data-recital=\"31\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(31) Taking into account the potential systemic <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> entailed by increased outsourcing practices and by the ICT third-party concentration, and mindful of the insufficiency of national mechanisms in providing financial supervisors with adequate tools to quantify, qualify and redress the consequences of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> occurring at <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>, it is necessary to establish an appropriate Oversight Framework allowing for a continuous monitoring of the activities of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> that are <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, while ensuring that the confidentiality and security of customers other than financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> is preserved. While intra-<span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> provision of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> entails specific <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> and benefits, it should not be automatically considered less risky than the provision of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> by providers outside of a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> and should therefore be subject to the same regulatory framework. However, when <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> are provided from within the same financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span>, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> might have a higher level of control over intra-<span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> providers, which ought to be taken into account in the overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> assessment.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-32\" data-recital=\"32\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(32) With <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, good measures for the detection and prevention of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> depend to a great extent on the regular sharing between financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> of threat and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"vulnerability\" tabindex=\"0\">vulnerability</span> intelligence. Information sharing contributes to creating increased awareness of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span>. In turn, this enhances the capacity of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to prevent <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span> from becoming real <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incidents</span> and enables financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to more effectively contain the impact of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incidents</span> and to recover faster. In the absence of guidance at Union level, several factors seem to have inhibited such intelligence sharing, in particular uncertainty about its compatibility with data protection, anti-trust and liability rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-33\" data-recital=\"33\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(33) In addition, doubts about the type of information that can be shared with other market participants, or with non-<span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"supervisory-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">supervisory authorities</span> (such as ENISA, for analytical input, or Europol, for law enforcement purposes) lead to useful information being withheld. Therefore, the extent and quality of information sharing currently remains limited and fragmented, with relevant exchanges mostly being local (by way of national initiatives) and with no consistent Union-wide information-sharing arrangements tailored to the needs of an integrated financial system. It is therefore important to strengthen those <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"communication\" tabindex=\"0\">communication</span> channels.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-34\" data-recital=\"34\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(34) Financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should be encouraged to exchange among themselves <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threat</span> information and intelligence, and to collectively leverage their individual knowledge and practical experience at strategic, tactical and operational levels with a view to enhancing their capabilities to adequately assess, monitor, defend against, and respond to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span>, by participating in information sharing arrangements. It is therefore necessary to enable the emergence at Union level of mechanisms for voluntary information-sharing arrangements which, when conducted in trusted environments, would help the community of the financial industry to prevent and collectively respond to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span> by quickly limiting the spread of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> and impeding potential contagion throughout the financial channels. Those mechanisms should comply with the applicable competition law rules of the Union set out in the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"communication\" tabindex=\"0\">Communication</span> from the Commission of 14 January 2011 entitled ‘Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal cooperation agreements’, as well as with Union data protection rules, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). They should operate based on the use of one or more of the legal bases that are laid down in Article 6 of that Regulation, such as in the context of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"personal-data\" tabindex=\"0\">personal data</span> that is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest pursued by the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"controller\" tabindex=\"0\">controller</span> or by a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"third-party\" tabindex=\"0\">third party</span>, as referred to in Article 6(1), point (f), of that Regulation, as well as in the context of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"personal-data\" tabindex=\"0\">personal data</span> necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"controller\" tabindex=\"0\">controller</span> is subject, necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"controller\" tabindex=\"0\">controller</span>, as referred to in Article 6(1), points (c) and (e), respectively, of that Regulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-35\" data-recital=\"35\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(35) In order to maintain a high level of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> for the whole financial sector, and at the same time to keep pace with technological developments, this Regulation should address <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> stemming from all types of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span>. To that end, the definition of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> in the context of this Regulation should be understood in a broad manner, encompassing digital and data <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> provided through ICT systems to one or more internal or external <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"user\" tabindex=\"0\">users</span> on an ongoing basis.

It should exclude only the limited category of traditional analogue telephone <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> qualifying as Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, landline <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, Plain Old Telephone <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">Service</span> (POTS), or fixed-line telephone <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-36\" data-recital=\"36\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(36) Notwithstanding the broad coverage envisaged by this Regulation, the application of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> rules should take into account the significant differences between financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> in terms of their size and overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> profile. As a general principle, when distributing resources and capabilities for the implementation of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should duly balance their ICT-related needs to their size and overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, activities and operations, while competent authorities should continue to assess and review the approach of such distribution.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-37\" data-recital=\"37\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(37) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"account-information-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">Account information service providers</span>, referred to in Article 33(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, are explicitly included in the scope of this Regulation, taking into account the specific nature of their activities and the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> arising therefrom. In addition, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"electronic-money-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">electronic money institutions</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"payment-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">payment institutions</span> exempted pursuant to Article 9(1) of Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and Article 32(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 are included in the scope of this Regulation even if they have not been granted authorisation in accordance Directive 2009/110/EC to issue electronic money, or if they have not been granted authorisation in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/2366 to provide and execute payment <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>. However, post office giro institutions, referred to in Article 2(5), point (3), of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), are excluded from the scope of this Regulation. The competent authority for <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"payment-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">payment institutions</span> exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"electronic-money-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">electronic money institutions</span> exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"account-information-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">account information service providers</span> as referred to in Article 33(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, should be the competent authority designated in accordance with Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-38\" data-recital=\"38\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(38) As larger financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> might enjoy wider resources and can swiftly deploy funds to develop governance structures and set up various corporate strategies, only financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> that are not <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">microenterprises</span> in the sense of this Regulation should be required to establish more complex governance arrangements. Such <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> are better equipped in particular to set up dedicated management functions for supervising arrangements with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> or for dealing with crisis management, to organise their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management according to the three lines of defence model, or to set up an internal <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> management and control model, and to submit their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework to internal audits.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-39\" data-recital=\"39\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(39) Some financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> benefit from exemptions or are subject to a very light regulatory framework under the relevant sector-specific Union law. Such financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> include managers of alternative investment funds referred to in Article 3(2) of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), insurance and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"reinsurance-undertaking\" tabindex=\"0\">reinsurance undertakings</span> referred to in Article 4 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), and institutions for occupational retirement provision which operate pension schemes which together do not have more than 15 members in total. In light of those exemptions it would not be proportionate to include such financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> in the scope of this Regulation. In addition, this Regulation acknowledges the specificities of the insurance intermediation market structure, with the result that <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"insurance-intermediary\" tabindex=\"0\">insurance intermediaries</span>, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"reinsurance-intermediary\" tabindex=\"0\">reinsurance intermediaries</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ancillary-insurance-intermediary\" tabindex=\"0\">ancillary insurance intermediaries</span> qualifying as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">microenterprises</span> or as small or <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"medium-sized-enterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">medium-sized enterprises</span> should not be subject to this Regulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-40\" data-recital=\"40\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(40) Since the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> referred to in Article 2(5), points (4) to (23), of Directive 2013/36/EU are excluded from the scope of that Directive, Member States should consequently be able to choose to exempt from the application of this Regulation such <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> located within their respective territories.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-41\" data-recital=\"41\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(41) Similarly, in order to align this Regulation to the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), it is also appropriate to exclude from the scope of this Regulation natural and legal persons referred in Articles 2 and 3 of that Directive which are allowed to provide investment <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> without having to obtain an authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU. However, Article 2 of Directive 2014/65/EU also excludes from the scope of that Directive <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> which qualify as financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> for the purposes of this Regulation such as, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"central-securities-depository\" tabindex=\"0\">central securities depositories</span>, collective investment undertakings or insurance and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"reinsurance-undertaking\" tabindex=\"0\">reinsurance undertakings</span>. The exclusion from the scope of this Regulation of the persons and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of that Directive should not encompass those <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"central-securities-depository\" tabindex=\"0\">central securities depositories</span>, collective investment undertakings or insurance and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"reinsurance-undertaking\" tabindex=\"0\">reinsurance undertakings</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-42\" data-recital=\"42\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(42) Under sector-specific Union law, some financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> are subject to lighter requirements or exemptions for reasons associated with their size or the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> they provide. That category of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> includes <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"small-and-non-interconnected-investment-firm\" tabindex=\"0\">small and non-interconnected investment firms</span>, small institutions for occupational retirement provision which may be excluded from the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 under the conditions laid down in Article 5 of that Directive by the Member State concerned and operate pension schemes which together do not have more than 100 members in total, as well as institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and to preserve the spirit of sector-specific Union law, it is also appropriate to subject those financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to a simplified <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework under this Regulation. The proportionate character of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework covering those financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should not be altered by the regulatory technical <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> that are to be developed by the ESAs. Moreover, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is appropriate to also subject <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"payment-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">payment institutions</span> referred to in Article 32(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"electronic-money-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">electronic money institutions</span> referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2009/110/EC exempted in accordance with national law transposing those Union legal acts to a simplified <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework under this Regulation, while <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"payment-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">payment institutions</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"electronic-money-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">electronic money institutions</span> which have not been exempted in accordance with their respective national law transposing sectoral Union law should comply with the general framework laid down by this Regulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-43\" data-recital=\"43\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(43) Similarly, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> which qualify as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">microenterprises</span> or are subject to the simplified <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework under this Regulation should not be required to establish a role to monitor their arrangements concluded with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> on the use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span>; or to designate a member of senior management to be responsible for overseeing the related <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> exposure and relevant documentation; to assign the responsibility for managing and overseeing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> to a control function and ensure an appropriate level of independence of such control function in order to avoid conflicts of interest; to document and review at least once a year the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework; to subject to internal audit on a regular basis the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework; to perform in-depth assessments after major changes in their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"network-and-information-system\" tabindex=\"0\">network and information system</span> infrastructures and processes; to regularly conduct <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> analyses on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"legacy-ict-system\" tabindex=\"0\">legacy ICT systems</span>; to subject the implementation of the ICT Response and Recovery plans to independent internal audit reviews; to have a crisis management function, to expand the testing of business continuity and response and recovery plans to capture switchover scenarios between primary ICT infrastructure and redundant facilities; to report to competent authorities, upon their request, an estimation of aggregated annual costs and losses caused by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span>, to maintain redundant ICT capacities; to communicate to national competent authorities implemented changes following post <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reviews; to monitor on a continuous basis relevant technological developments, to establish a comprehensive <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing programme as an integral part of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework provided for in this Regulation, or to adopt and regularly review a strategy on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span>. In addition, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">microenterprises</span> should only be required to assess the need to maintain such redundant ICT capacities based on their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> profile. <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">Microenterprises</span> should benefit from a more flexible regime as regards <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing programmes. When considering the type and frequency of testing to be performed, they should properly balance the objective of maintaining a high <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span>, the available resources and their overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> profile. <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">Microenterprises</span> and financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> subject to the simplified <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework under this Regulation should be exempted from the requirement to perform advanced testing of ICT tools, systems and processes based on threat-led penetration testing (TLPT), as only financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation should be required to carry out such testing. In light of their limited capabilities, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"microenterprise\" tabindex=\"0\">microenterprises</span> should be able to agree with the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span> to delegate the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span>’s rights of access, inspection and audit to an independent third-party, to be appointed by the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span>, provided that the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> is able to request, at any time, all relevant information and assurance on the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span>’s performance from the respective independent third-party.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-44\" data-recital=\"44\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(44) As only those financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> identified for the purposes of the advanced digital resilience testing should be required to conduct threat-led penetration tests, the administrative processes and financial costs entailed in the performance of such tests should be borne by a small percentage of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-45\" data-recital=\"45\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(45) To ensure full alignment and overall consistency between financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>’ business strategies, on the one hand, and the conduct of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management, on the other hand, the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>’ <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"management-body\" tabindex=\"0\">management bodies</span> should be required to maintain a pivotal and active role in steering and adapting the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management framework and the overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> strategy. The approach to be taken by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"management-body\" tabindex=\"0\">management bodies</span> should not only focus on the means of ensuring the resilience of the ICT systems, but should also cover people and processes through a set of policies which cultivate, at each corporate layer, and for all staff, a strong sense of awareness about cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> and a commitment to observe a strict cyber hygiene at all levels. The ultimate responsibility of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"management-body\" tabindex=\"0\">management body</span> in managing a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span>’s <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> should be an overarching principle of that comprehensive approach, further translated into the continuous engagement of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"management-body\" tabindex=\"0\">management body</span> in the control of the monitoring of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-46\" data-recital=\"46\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(46) Moreover, the principle of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"management-body\" tabindex=\"0\">management body</span>’s full and ultimate responsibility for the management of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> of the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> goes hand in hand with the need to secure a level of ICT-related investments and an overall budget for the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> that would enable the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> to achieve a high level of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-47\" data-recital=\"47\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(47) Inspired by relevant international, national and industry best practices, guidelines, recommendations and approaches to the management of cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, this Regulation promotes a set of principles that facilitate the overall structure of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management. Consequently, as long as the main capabilities which financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> put in place address the various functions in the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management (identification, protection and prevention, detection, response and recovery, learning and evolving and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"communication\" tabindex=\"0\">communication</span>) set out in this Regulation, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should remain free to use <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management models that are differently framed or categorised.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-48\" data-recital=\"48\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(48) To keep pace with an evolving <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threat</span> landscape, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should maintain updated ICT systems that are reliable and capable, not only for guaranteeing the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> of data required for their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, but also for ensuring sufficient technological resilience to allow them to deal adequately with additional <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> needs due to stressed market conditions or other adverse situations.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-49\" data-recital=\"49\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(49) Efficient business continuity and recovery plans are necessary to allow financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to promptly and quickly resolve <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incidents</span>, in particular <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-attack\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber-attacks</span>, by limiting damage and giving priority to the resumption of activities and recovery actions in accordance with their back-up policies. However, such resumption should in no way jeopardise the integrity and security of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"network-and-information-system\" tabindex=\"0\">network and information systems</span> or the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-50\" data-recital=\"50\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(50) While this Regulation allows financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to determine their recovery time and recovery point objectives in a flexible manner and hence to set such objectives by fully taking into account the nature and the criticality of the relevant functions and any specific business needs, it should nevertheless require them to carry out an assessment of the potential overall impact on market efficiency when determining such objectives.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-51\" data-recital=\"51\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(51) The propagators of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-attack\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber-attacks</span> tend to pursue financial gains directly at the source, thus exposing financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to significant consequences. To prevent ICT systems from losing integrity or becoming unavailable, and hence to avoid data breaches and damage to physical ICT infrastructure, the reporting of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span> by financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should be significantly improved and streamlined. <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT-related incident</span> reporting should be harmonised through the introduction of a requirement for all financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to report directly to their relevant competent authorities. Where a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> is subject to supervision by more than one national competent authority, Member States should designate a single competent authority as the addressee of such reporting. <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"credit-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">Credit institutions</span> classified as significant in accordance with Article 6(4) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (19) should submit such reporting to the national competent authorities, which should subsequently transmit the report to the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-52\" data-recital=\"52\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(52) The direct reporting should enable financial supervisors to have immediate access to information about <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span>. Financial supervisors should in turn pass on details of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span> to public non-financial authorities (such as competent authorities and single points of contact under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, national data protection authorities, and to law enforcement authorities for <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span> of a criminal nature) in order to enhance such authorities awareness of such <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> and, in the case of CSIRTs, to facilitate prompt assistance that may be given to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, as appropriate. Member States should, in addition, be able to determine that financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> themselves should provide such information to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"public-authority\" tabindex=\"0\">public authorities</span> outside the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> area. Those information flows should allow financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> to swiftly benefit from any relevant technical input, advice about remedies, and subsequent follow-up from such authorities. The information on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incidents</span> should be mutually channelled: financial supervisors should provide all necessary feedback or guidance to the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span>, while the ESAs should share anonymised data on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"vulnerability\" tabindex=\"0\">vulnerabilities</span> relating to an <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incident</span>, to aid wider collective defence.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-53\" data-recital=\"53\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(53) While all financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should be required to carry out <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incident</span> reporting, that requirement is not expected to affect all of them in the same manner.

Such advanced testing should be required only of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> that are mature enough from an ICT perspective to reasonably carry it out. The <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> testing required by this Regulation should thus be more demanding for those financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation (for example, large, systemic and ICT-mature <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"credit-institution\" tabindex=\"0\">credit institutions</span>, stock exchanges, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"central-securities-depository\" tabindex=\"0\">central securities depositories</span> and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"central-counterparty\" tabindex=\"0\">central counterparties</span>) than for other financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>.

Similarly, since financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should effectively and coherently identify and manage all types of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, including in the context of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> procured within a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span>, it should be clarified that undertakings which are part of a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> and provide <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> predominantly to their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"parent-undertaking\" tabindex=\"0\">parent undertaking</span>, or to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"subsidiary\" tabindex=\"0\">subsidiaries</span> or branches of their <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"parent-undertaking\" tabindex=\"0\">parent undertaking</span>, as well as financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> providing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> to other financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, should also be considered as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> under this Regulation.

To enhance supervisory awareness of ICT third-party dependencies, and with a view to further supporting the work in the context of the Oversight Framework established by this Regulation, all financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should be required to maintain a register of information with all contractual arrangements about the use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> provided by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span>. Financial supervisors should be able to request the full register, or to ask for specific sections thereof, and thus to obtain essential information for acquiring a broader understanding of the ICT dependencies of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-66\" data-recital=\"66\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(66) A thorough pre-contracting analysis should underpin and precede the formal conclusion of contractual arrangements, in particular by focusing on elements such as the criticality or importance of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> supported by the envisaged ICT contract, the necessary supervisory approvals or other conditions, the possible concentration <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> entailed, as well as applying due diligence in the process of selection and assessment of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> and assessing potential conflicts of interest. For contractual arrangements concerning <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-or-important-function\" tabindex=\"0\">critical or important functions</span>, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should take into consideration the use by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> of the most up-to-date and highest information security <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span>. Termination of contractual arrangements could be prompted at least by a series of circumstances showing shortfalls at the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span> level, in particular significant breaches of laws or contractual terms, circumstances revealing a potential alteration of the performance of the functions provided for in the contractual arrangements, evidence of weaknesses of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span> in its overall <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management, or circumstances indicating the inability of the relevant competent authority to effectively supervise the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-67\" data-recital=\"67\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(67) To address the systemic impact of ICT third-party concentration <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span>, this Regulation promotes a balanced solution by means of taking a flexible and gradual approach to such concentration <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> since the imposition of any rigid caps or strict limitations might hinder the conduct of business and restrain the contractual freedom. Financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> should thoroughly assess their envisaged contractual arrangements to identify the likelihood of such <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> emerging, including by means of in-depth analyses of subcontracting arrangements, in particular when concluded with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> established in a third country. At this stage, and with a view to striking a fair balance between the imperative of preserving contractual freedom and that of guaranteeing financial stability, it is not considered appropriate to set out rules on strict caps and limits to ICT third-party exposures. In the context of the Oversight Framework, a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span>, appointed pursuant to this Regulation, should, in respect to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>, pay particular attention to fully grasp the magnitude of interdependences, discover specific instances where a high degree of concentration of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> in the Union is likely to put a strain on the Union financial system’s stability and integrity and maintain a dialogue with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> where that specific <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> is identified.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-68\" data-recital=\"68\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(68) To evaluate and monitor on a regular basis the ability of an <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third party service provider</span> to securely provide <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> to a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> without adverse effects on a financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span>’s <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span>, several key contractual elements with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> should be harmonised.

The development of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standard</span> contractual clauses builds on measures already envisaged in the 2018 Fintech Action Plan that announced the Commission’s intention to encourage and facilitate the development of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standard</span> contractual clauses for the use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cloud-computing-service\" tabindex=\"0\">cloud computing services</span> outsourcing by financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, drawing on cross-sectorial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cloud-computing-service\" tabindex=\"0\">cloud computing services</span> stakeholders’ efforts, which the Commission has facilitated with the help of the financial sector’s involvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-76\" data-recital=\"76\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(76) With a view to promoting convergence and efficiency in relation to supervisory approaches when addressing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span> in the financial sector, as well as to strengthening the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> which rely on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> for the provision of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> that support the supply of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, and thereby to contributing to the preservation of the Union’s financial system stability and the integrity of the internal market for financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> should be subject to a Union Oversight Framework. While the set-up of the Oversight Framework is justified by the added value of taking action at Union level and by virtue of the inherent role and specificities of the use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> in the provision of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, it should be recalled, at the same time, that this solution appears suitable only in the context of this Regulation specifically dealing with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> in the financial sector. However, such Oversight Framework should not be regarded as a new model for Union supervision in other areas of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> and activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-77\" data-recital=\"77\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(77) The Oversight Framework should apply only to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>. There should therefore be a designation mechanism to take into account the dimension and nature of the financial sector’s reliance on such <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span>. That mechanism should involve a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to set the criticality parameters as a basis for inclusion in the Oversight Framework. In order to ensure the accuracy of that assessment, and regardless of the corporate structure of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span>, such criteria should, in the case of a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span> that is part of a wider <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span>, take into consideration the entire <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider</span>’s <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> structure. On the one hand, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>, which are not automatically designated by virtue of the application of those criteria, should have the possibility to opt in to the Oversight Framework on a voluntary basis, on the other hand, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span>, that are already subject to oversight mechanism frameworks supporting the fulfilment of the tasks of the European System of Central Banks as referred to in Article 127(2) TFEU, should be exempted.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-78\" data-recital=\"78\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(78) Similarly, financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> providing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> to other financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, while belonging to the category of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> under this Regulation, should also be exempted from the Oversight Framework since they are already subject to supervisory mechanisms established by the relevant Union financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> law. Where applicable, competent authorities should take into account, in the context of their supervisory activities, the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> posed to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> by financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> providing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span>. Likewise, due to the existing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> monitoring mechanisms at <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> level, the same exemption should be introduced for <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> delivering <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> predominantly to the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> of their own <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span>. <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> providing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> solely in one Member State to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> that are active only in that Member State should also be exempted from the designation mechanism because of their limited activities and lack of cross-border impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-79\" data-recital=\"79\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(79) The digital transformation experienced in financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> has brought about an unprecedented level of use of, and reliance upon, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span>. Since it has become inconceivable to provide financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> without the use of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cloud-computing-service\" tabindex=\"0\">cloud computing services</span>, software solutions and data-related <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, the Union financial ecosystem has become intrinsically co-dependent on certain <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> provided by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-service\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT service</span> suppliers. Some of those suppliers, innovators in developing and applying ICT-based technologies, play a significant role in the delivery of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, or have become integrated into the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> value chain. They have thus become critical to the stability and integrity of the Union financial system. This widespread reliance on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> supplied by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>, combined with the interdependence of the information systems of various market operators, create a direct, and potentially severe, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> to the Union financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> system and to the continuity of delivery of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> if <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> were to be affected by operational disruptions or major cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span>. Cyber <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"incident\" tabindex=\"0\">incidents</span> have a distinctive ability to multiply and propagate throughout the financial system at a considerably faster pace than other types of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risk</span> monitored in the financial sector and can extend across sectors and beyond geographical borders. They have the potential to evolve into a systemic crisis, where trust in the financial system has been eroded due to the disruption of functions supporting the real economy, or to substantial financial losses, reaching a level which the financial system is unable to withstand, or which requires the deployment of heavy shock absorption measures. To prevent these scenarios from taking place and thereby endangering the financial stability and integrity of the Union, it is essential to provide the convergence of supervisory practices relating to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span> in finance, in particular through new rules enabling the Union oversight of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-80\" data-recital=\"80\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(80) The Oversight Framework largely depends on the degree of collaboration between the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> and the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span> delivering to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> affecting the supply of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>. Successful oversight is predicated, inter alia, upon the ability of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> to effectively conduct monitoring missions and inspections to assess the rules, controls and processes used by the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>, as well as to assess the potential cumulative impact of their activities on financial stability and the integrity of the financial system. At the same time, it is crucial that <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> follow the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span>’s recommendations and address its concerns. Since a lack of cooperation by a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span> providing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> that affect the supply of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, such as the refusal to grant access to its premises or to submit information, would ultimately deprive the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> of its essential tools in appraising <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span>, and could adversely impact the financial stability and the integrity of the financial system, it is necessary to also provide for a commensurate sanctioning regime.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-81\" data-recital=\"81\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(81) Against this background, the need of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> to impose penalty payments to compel <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> to comply with the transparency and access-related obligations set out in this Regulation should not be jeopardised by difficulties raised by the enforcement of those penalty payments in relation to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> established in third countries. In order to ensure the enforceability of such penalties, and to allow a swift roll out of procedures upholding the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>’ rights of defence in the context of the designation mechanism and the issuance of recommendations, those <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span>, providing <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> that affect the supply of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span>, should be required to maintain an adequate business presence in the Union. Due to the nature of the oversight, and the absence of comparable arrangements in other jurisdictions, there are no suitable alternative mechanisms ensuring this objective by way of effective cooperation with financial supervisors in third countries in relation to the monitoring of the impact of digital operational <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span> posed by systemic <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span>, qualifying as <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> established in third countries. Therefore, in order to continue its provision of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> in the Union, an <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider-established-in-a-third-country\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service provider established in a third country</span> which has been designated as critical in accordance with this Regulation should undertake, within 12 months of such designation, all necessary arrangements to ensure its incorporation within the Union, by means of establishing a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"subsidiary\" tabindex=\"0\">subsidiary</span>, as defined throughout the Union acquis, namely in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (21).</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-82\" data-recital=\"82\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(82) The requirement to set up a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"subsidiary\" tabindex=\"0\">subsidiary</span> in the Union should not prevent the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span> from supplying <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> and related technical support from facilities and infrastructure located outside the Union. This Regulation does not impose a data localisation obligation as it does not require data storage or <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> to be undertaken in the Union.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-83\" data-recital=\"83\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(83) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">Critical ICT third-party service providers</span> should be able to provide <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> from anywhere in the world, not necessarily or not only from premises located in the Union. Oversight activities should be first conducted on premises located in the Union and by interacting with <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> located in the Union, including the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"subsidiary\" tabindex=\"0\">subsidiaries</span> established by <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> pursuant to this Regulation. However, such actions within the Union might be insufficient to allow the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> to fully and effectively perform its duties under this Regulation. The <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> should therefore also be able to exercise its relevant oversight powers in third countries. Exercising those powers in third countries should allow the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> to examine the facilities from which the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-services\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT services</span> or the technical support <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> are actually provided or managed by the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span>, and should give the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> a comprehensive and operational understanding of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span>. The possibility for the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span>, as a Union agency, to exercise powers outside the territory of the Union should be duly framed by relevant conditions, in particular the consent of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span> concerned. Similarly, the relevant authorities of the third country should be informed of, and not have objected to, the exercise on their own territory of the activities of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span>. However, in order to ensure efficient implementation, and without prejudice to the respective competences of the Union institutions and the Member States, such powers also need to be fully anchored in the conclusion of administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant authorities of the third country concerned. This Regulation should therefore enable the ESAs to conclude administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant authorities of third countries, which should not otherwise create legal obligations in respect of the Union and its Member States.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-84\" data-recital=\"84\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(84) To facilitate <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"communication\" tabindex=\"0\">communication</span> with the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> and to ensure adequate representation, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> which are part of a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">group</span> should designate one legal person as their coordination point.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-85\" data-recital=\"85\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(85) The Oversight Framework should be without prejudice to Member States’ competence to conduct their own oversight or monitoring missions in respect to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party service providers</span> which are not designated as critical under this Regulation, but which are regarded as important at national level.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-86\" data-recital=\"86\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(86) To leverage the multi-layered institutional architecture in the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"service\" tabindex=\"0\">services</span> area, the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"joint-committee\" tabindex=\"0\">Joint Committee</span> of the ESAs should continue to ensure overall cross-sectoral coordination in relation to all matters pertaining to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span>, in accordance with its tasks on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cybersecurity\" tabindex=\"0\">cybersecurity</span>.

The individual assignment of a <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service provider</span> to one of the three ESAs should result from an assessment of the preponderance of financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> operating in the financial sectors for which that ESA has responsibilities. This approach should lead to a balanced allocation of tasks and responsibilities between the three ESAs, in the context of exercising the oversight functions, and should make the best use of the human resources and technical expertise available in each of the three ESAs.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-88\" data-recital=\"88\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(88) <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseers</span> should be granted the necessary powers to conduct investigations, to carry out onsite and offsite inspections at the premises and locations of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> and to obtain complete and updated information. Those powers should enable the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> to acquire real insight into the type, dimension and impact of the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span> posed to financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> and ultimately to the Union’s financial system. Entrusting the ESAs with the lead oversight role is a prerequisite for understanding and addressing the systemic dimension of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> in finance. The impact of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> on the Union financial sector and the potential issues caused by the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-concentration-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT concentration risk</span> entailed call for taking a collective approach at Union level. The simultaneous carrying out of multiple audits and access rights, performed separately by numerous competent authorities, with little or no coordination among them, would prevent financial supervisors from obtaining a complete and comprehensive overview of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span> in the Union, while also creating redundancy, burden and complexity for <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> if they were subject to numerous monitoring and inspection requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-89\" data-recital=\"89\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(89) Due to the significant impact of being designated as critical, this Regulation should ensure that the rights of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> are observed throughout the implementation of the Oversight Framework. Prior to being designated as critical, such providers should, for example, have the right to submit to the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> a reasoned statement containing any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment related to their designation. Since the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"lead-overseer\" tabindex=\"0\">Lead Overseer</span> should be empowered to submit recommendations on <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> matters and suitable remedies thereto, which include the power to oppose certain contractual arrangements ultimately affecting the stability of the financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entity</span> or the financial system, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">critical ICT third-party service providers</span> should also be given the opportunity to provide, prior to the finalisation of those recommendations, explanations regarding the expected impact of the solutions, envisaged in the recommendations, on customers that are <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> falling outside the scope of this Regulation and to formulate solutions to mitigate <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"0\">risks</span>. <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"critical-ict-third-party-service-provider\" tabindex=\"0\">Critical ICT third-party service providers</span> disagreeing with the recommendations should submit a reasoned explanation of their intention not to endorse the recommendation.

This Regulation therefore provides for a hybrid funding model, whereby the Oversight Framework would, as such, be fully fee-funded, while the development of the ESAs’ ICT systems would be funded from Union and national competent authorities’ contributions.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-97\" data-recital=\"97\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(97) Competent authorities should have all required supervisory, investigative and sanctioning powers to ensure the proper exercise of their duties under this Regulation.

It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (22). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"group\" tabindex=\"0\">groups</span> dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-99\" data-recital=\"99\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(99) Regulatory technical <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> should ensure the consistent harmonisation of the requirements laid down in this Regulation. In their roles as bodies endowed with highly specialised expertise, the ESAs should develop draft regulatory technical <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission. Regulatory technical <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"standard\" tabindex=\"0\">standards</span> should be developed in the areas of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT risk</span> management, <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"major-ict-related-incident\" tabindex=\"0\">major ICT-related incident</span> reporting, testing, as well as in relation to key requirements for a sound monitoring of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"ict-third-party-risk\" tabindex=\"0\">ICT third-party risk</span>.

To that effect, the Commission should swiftly assess the need for reviewing the scope of this Regulation while aligning such review with the outcome of the comprehensive review envisaged under Directive (EU) 2015/2366. Numerous large-scale attacks over the past decade demonstrate how payment systems have become exposed to <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"cyber-threat\" tabindex=\"0\">cyber threats</span>.

Until a harmonised regime and the supervision of operators of payment systems and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> are put in place at Union level, Member States may, with a view to applying similar market practices, draw inspiration from the <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> requirements laid down by this Regulation, when applying rules to operators of payment systems and <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"processing\" tabindex=\"0\">processing</span> <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span> supervised under their own jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"recital-105\" data-recital=\"105\" class=\"linkable-recital\">\n<p>(105) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to achieve a high level of <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"digital-operational-resilience\" tabindex=\"0\">digital operational resilience</span> for regulated financial <span class=\"term-link\" data-term-id=\"entity\" tabindex=\"0\">entities</span>, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because it requires harmonisation of various different rules in Union and national law, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
