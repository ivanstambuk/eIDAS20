This allows the demonstration of their legal validity over extended periods of time and guarantees that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes. These services are provided independently, or as a part of another qualified trust service such as qualified electronic archiving services.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 34(1a) and Article 40 of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> should only apply where qualified preservation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service, as well as the ability to verify the qualified status and technical validity of the signatures and seals over time.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service.
