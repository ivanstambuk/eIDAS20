By binding date and time information to electronic data, qualified electronic time stamps help ensuring the accuracy of date and time they indicate and the integrity of digital documents to which the date and time are bound.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 42(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified trust services for the issuance of qualified time stamps comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service and of the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\\], the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (5) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj.\\] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (6) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\\] and delivered its opinion on 06 June 2025.\n\n- (7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n\nThe reference standards and specifications referred to in Article 42(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n\n### Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\n---\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 September 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\n\n# ANNEX\n\n## ANNEX\n\n- 1.
