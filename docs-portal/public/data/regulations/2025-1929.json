By binding date and time information to electronic data, qualified electronic time stamps help ensuring the accuracy of date and time they indicate and the integrity of digital documents to which the date and time are bound.\n\n- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 42(1a) of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> should only apply where qualified trust services for the issuance of qualified time stamps comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service and of the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source.\n\n- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service.
