These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service and of the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source.\n\n(3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service.
