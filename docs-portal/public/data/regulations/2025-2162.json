The resulting conformity assessment reports confirm whether the requirements laid down in that Regulation and in Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Directive 2022/2555\" data-celex=\"32022L2555\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj\">Directive 2022/2555</span> are fulfilled. Consequently, it is necessary to establish a harmonised and robust framework for the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, the conformity assessment schemes they implement, the conformity assessments they perform in accordance with those schemes, and the resulting conformity assessment reports.\n\n- (2) The accreditation of conformity assessment bodies assessing qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide, the conformity assessment report and the conformity assessment scheme should meet the requirements laid down in this Regulation. Conformity assessment bodies may satisfy these requirements either independently, by utilising composite certification or by subcontracting to duly accredited entities.\n\n- (3) Conformity assessment bodies accredited for assessing qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide as regards the issuance of qualified electronic attestations of attributes should be permitted to issue the conformity assessment report required by Article 45f(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (4) To contribute to the transparency of the accreditation process, the accreditation certificate issued to a conformity assessment body in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Regulation 765/2008\" data-celex=\"32008R0765\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2008/765/oj\">Regulation 765/2008</span>, should contain sufficient information to enable third parties to verify that the accredited conformity assessment body is authorised to conduct a conformity assessment under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (5) To maintain the integrity and accuracy of accreditation certificates, national accreditation bodies should ensure that these certificates reflect up-to-date information.\n\n- (6) To ensure the integrity of the accreditation process, the accreditation certificate issued to a conformity assessment body may be subject to suspension or withdrawal at any time for each qualified trust service that the conformity assessment body has been accredited to assess. Suspension or withdrawal may occur after sanctioning by the national accreditation body or voluntarily by the conformity assessment body itself.\n\n- (7) For the purpose of harmonisation of this accreditation framework, this Regulation should be based on established standards, which reflect established practices and which are widely recognised within the relevant sectors.\n\n- (8) To enhance transparency, conformity assessment bodies should make the certificates of conformity that they issue publicly available. The certificates of conformity confirm the positive certification decisions taken by the conformity assessment bodies. However, the qualified status is only granted to, or withdrawn from, the trust service provider and the trust services they provide, by the supervisory body.\n\n- (9) To assess the compliance of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, conformity assessment bodies should use a conformity assessment scheme. Conformity assessment bodies should apply standards as benchmarks to assess qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide, taking into account the versions and adaptations to these standards set out in the service specific implementing acts based on Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors.\n\n- (10) Conformity assessment schemes set out the rules and procedures to be used by conformity assessment bodies in their assessments of qualified trust service providers and of the qualified trust services that they provide. Such schemes are evaluated by national accreditation bodies against the requirements set out in this Regulation. The content of such schemes is subject to changes over time. To facilitate the application of successive versions of conformity assessment schemes, the accredited conformity assessment bodies should put in place a specific process to manage evolutions of a scheme for which they are accredited.\n\n- (11) To oversee the development and maintenance of the conformity assessment schemes, each conformity assessment scheme should be assigned a scheme owner. Conformity assessment bodies, governmental bodies or an authority, a trade association, a group of conformity assessment bodies, or any appropriate body or group of bodies could be a scheme owner and could be different from the conformity assessment body operating the scheme.\n\n- (12) To ensure the continuity of the provision of their services, the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies should remain valid for earlier versions of standards referenced in the conformity assessment scheme. In those instances, the conformity assessment bodies should refer to those earlier versions of the standards explicitly, including the year and version number.\n\n- (13) To enhance flexibility, national accreditation bodies should be permitted to offer flexible scope accreditation, enabling conformity assessment bodies, in specific circumstances, to include additional activities in their scope of accreditation without the need for an evaluation by the national accreditation body. When designing the flexible scope accreditation, national accreditation bodies will consider the accreditation of flexible scopes as set out by European cooperation for Accreditation, appointed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Where national accreditation bodies allow conformity assessment bodies to make use of such flexible scope accreditation, they should indicate it in the accreditation certificate for transparency purposes. To enhance flexibility even where national accreditation bodies do not offer flexible scope accreditation, they should carefully consider, before re-evaluating the accredited conformity assessment body, the impact of the changes to the conformity assessment scheme for which that body has been accredited.\n\n- (14) To ensure reliability of the conformity assessment schemes, owners should ensure that their conformity assessment schemes do not allow positive certification decisions, or any certificate of conformity, to be issued where the conformity assessment leads to the identification of any non-conformity with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, or with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, with regard to qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust service they provide. Indeed, while conformity assessment reports could include non-conformities and potential remediation plans, no certificate of conformity or positive certification decision should be issued when non-conformities are identified.\n\n- (15) To ensure transparency in their practices, scheme owners should make publicly available a summary of their conformity assessment schemes. The summary should contain a description of the set of rules and procedures followed for the assessment of the conformity of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.\n\n- (16) To support the quality, security and reliability of the qualified trust service provider’s activities, the conformity assessment report should identify, where appropriate, opportunities for improvement that could refine the manner in which the qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust services they provide meet the applicable requirements.\n\n- (17) To support transparency and to facilitate the verification by supervisory bodies that an assessed qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust services they provide meet the applicable requirements, the conformity assessment report should include certain minimum information. In particular, for the purpose of facilitating the identification of the service entries to be listed in the national trusted list in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, where applicable, a detailed description of the public key infrastructure functional hierarchy, per type of qualified trust service, should be provided in the conformity assessment report.\n\n- (18) To support transparency and facilitate the verification and monitoring of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, national accreditation bodies should, where applicable, provide an history of the scope of accreditation, including the start and, where applicable, the end date of the accreditation for each qualified trust service.\n\n- (19) To ensure continuity of conformity assessment bodies that have already been accredited, and to support the transition to the rules laid down in this Regulation, conformity assessment bodies that are currently accredited under standard ETSI EN 319403 version 2.2.2, or an earlier version thereof, would not need to be re-accredited under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 until 17 May 2027. After this date, the conformity assessment bodies should be evaluated by the national accreditation body against the requirements set out in this Regulation.\n\n- (20) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Regulation 2024/1183\" data-celex=\"32024R1183\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulations/2024-1183\">Regulation 2024/1183</span>, the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (21) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"5\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (22) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"6\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span> and delivered its opinion on 8 August 2025 \\[EDPS Formal comments on the draft regarding the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies performing the assessment of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide | European Data Protection Supervisor.\\].\n\n- (23) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Definitions**\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n- (1) 'scheme owner' means an entity or a group of entities which is responsible for developing and maintaining a conformity assessment scheme;\n- (2) 'certification decision' means a certification decision, which follows a conformity assessment conducted by a conformity assessment body where that body positively or negatively confirms the conformity of a specific qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust service it provides with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555;\n- (3) 'certificate of conformity' means a document by which a conformity assessment body attests a certification decision that positively confirms that a specific qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust service it provides comply with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555;\n- (4) 'conformity assessment scheme' means a set of rules and procedures to be used by conformity assessment bodies for the purpose of the assessment of the conformity of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services that they provide with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555;\n- (5) 'conformity assessment report' means a document that provides detailed information, where applicable supplementary to that contained in a certification decision and associated certificate of conformity, on the method used to carry out, in accordance with a conformity assessment scheme, a conformity assessment of the compliance of a specific qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust service it provides with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and of Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and on the results of the conformity assessment;\n- (6) 'accreditation' means an accreditation, as defined in Article 2, point 10 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008;\n- (7) 'flexible scope accreditation' means an accreditation where the specific conformity assessment activities for which accreditation is sought, or has been granted, are expressed to allow conformity assessment bodies to make changes in methodology and other parameters which fall within the competence of the conformity assessment body as confirmed by the national accreditation body;\n- (8) 'national accreditation body' means a national accreditation body as defined in Article 2, point 11, of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.\n\n### Article 2\n**Accreditation of conformity assessment bodies**\n\n1.

The scheme owner shall implement procedures to monitor any changes in the standards referred to in Article 2(1) or in Article 6(3), or to a conformity assessment scheme owned by it and on the basis of which a conformity assessment body has been accredited in accordance with Article 2.\n\n2. The scheme owner shall notify the national accreditation body of the changes identified as a result of the procedures referred to in paragraph 1, in a timely manner.\n\n3. Where the national accreditation body did not apply flexible scope accreditation to accredited conformity assessment bodies, the national accreditation body shall determine whether the changes, identified as a result of the procedures referred to in paragraph 1, are likely to materially affect the ability of accredited conformity assessment bodies to conduct conformity assessments pursuant to schemes for which they have been accredited.\n\n4. Where the national accreditation body determines, pursuant to paragraph 3, that changes do affect the ability of conformity assessment bodies to conduct conformity assessments, it shall request the conformity assessment body to take appropriate measures within a reasonable prescribed period.\n\n5. If the conformity assessment body is unable or unwilling to take the measures referred to in paragraph 4 within the period prescribed, the national accreditation body shall immediately withdraw or suspend the accreditation.\n\n6. Where the national accreditation body determines, pursuant to paragraph 3, that changes do not affect the ability of conformity assessment bodies to conduct conformity assessments, it may, where appropriate, extend the validity and scope of the accreditation of the assessed conformity assessment body.\n\n7. Where appropriate, the national accreditation body shall update the accreditation certificate in a timely manner to reflect the outcome of the reconsideration of the accreditation pursuant to this Article.\n\n8. Where a conformity assessment body receives a request pursuant to paragraph 4, it shall, in a timely manner, inform any qualified trust service providers that it has previously assessed under the relevant conformity assessment scheme of any impacts that the reconsideration of the conformity assessment body’s accreditation may have on those qualified trust service providers, including with respect to future certification decisions made by the conformity assessment body under that scheme.\n\n### Article 5\n**Conformity assessment bodies**\n\n1. Conformity assessment bodies shall make the certificates of conformity they issue available in a public repository maintained by that conformity assessment body for that purpose.\n\n2. Any subcontracting by the conformity assessment body of the performance of conformity assessment activities shall duly consider the nature of the activity to be performed.

Scheme owners shall ensure that their conformity assessment schemes require the qualified trust service providers to have processes, procedures and work instructions in place to notify the conformity assessment body at least one month before the qualified trust service providers implement any significant change in the provision of the qualified trust services certified under that scheme and at least three months before it intends to cease the provision of the services or parts thereof.\n\n7. Scheme owners shall ensure that their conformity assessment schemes do not allow positive certification decisions, or any certificate of conformity, to be issued where the conformity assessment leads to the identification of non-conformity of the assessed qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust service they provide with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and of Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.\n\n8. Scheme owners shall ensure that their conformity assessment schemes set out the procedure for the attestation of a certificate of conformity. They shall require, in particular, that the qualified trust service providers immediately inform the competent supervisory body of any change to a certificate of conformity. They shall also require that qualified trust services providers refrain from providing the qualified trust services concerned or from advertising any reference thereto until the competent supervisory body reconfirms the qualified status. This procedure shall comply with the requirements set out in clause 7.11 of standard ISO/IEC 17065:2012.\n\n9. Scheme owners shall ensure that their conformity assessment schemes set out the conformity assessment process to be conducted over a sufficient number of person-days and shall ensure that sufficient resources and time are allocated for the conformity assessment, taking into account the scope and the complexity of the assessment.\n\n10.

Conformity assessment bodies may satisfy these requirements either independently, by utilising composite certification or by subcontracting to duly accredited entities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(3) Conformity assessment bodies accredited for assessing qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide as regards the issuance of qualified electronic attestations of attributes should be permitted to issue the conformity assessment report required by Article 45f(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(4) To contribute to the transparency of the accreditation process, the accreditation certificate issued to a conformity assessment body in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Regulation 765/2008\" data-celex=\"32008R0765\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2008/765/oj\">Regulation 765/2008</span>, should contain sufficient information to enable third parties to verify that the accredited conformity assessment body is authorised to conduct a conformity assessment under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(5) To maintain the integrity and accuracy of accreditation certificates, national accreditation bodies should ensure that these certificates reflect up-to-date information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(6) To ensure the integrity of the accreditation process, the accreditation certificate issued to a conformity assessment body may be subject to suspension or withdrawal at any time for each qualified trust service that the conformity assessment body has been accredited to assess. Suspension or withdrawal may occur after sanctioning by the national accreditation body or voluntarily by the conformity assessment body itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(7) For the purpose of harmonisation of this accreditation framework, this Regulation should be based on established standards, which reflect established practices and which are widely recognised within the relevant sectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(8) To enhance transparency, conformity assessment bodies should make the certificates of conformity that they issue publicly available. The certificates of conformity confirm the positive certification decisions taken by the conformity assessment bodies. However, the qualified status is only granted to, or withdrawn from, the trust service provider and the trust services they provide, by the supervisory body.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(9) To assess the compliance of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, conformity assessment bodies should use a conformity assessment scheme. Conformity assessment bodies should apply standards as benchmarks to assess qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide, taking into account the versions and adaptations to these standards set out in the service specific implementing acts based on Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(10) Conformity assessment schemes set out the rules and procedures to be used by conformity assessment bodies in their assessments of qualified trust service providers and of the qualified trust services that they provide. Such schemes are evaluated by national accreditation bodies against the requirements set out in this Regulation. The content of such schemes is subject to changes over time. To facilitate the application of successive versions of conformity assessment schemes, the accredited conformity assessment bodies should put in place a specific process to manage evolutions of a scheme for which they are accredited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(11) To oversee the development and maintenance of the conformity assessment schemes, each conformity assessment scheme should be assigned a scheme owner. Conformity assessment bodies, governmental bodies or an authority, a trade association, a group of conformity assessment bodies, or any appropriate body or group of bodies could be a scheme owner and could be different from the conformity assessment body operating the scheme.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(12) To ensure the continuity of the provision of their services, the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies should remain valid for earlier versions of standards referenced in the conformity assessment scheme. In those instances, the conformity assessment bodies should refer to those earlier versions of the standards explicitly, including the year and version number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(13) To enhance flexibility, national accreditation bodies should be permitted to offer flexible scope accreditation, enabling conformity assessment bodies, in specific circumstances, to include additional activities in their scope of accreditation without the need for an evaluation by the national accreditation body. When designing the flexible scope accreditation, national accreditation bodies will consider the accreditation of flexible scopes as set out by European cooperation for Accreditation, appointed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Where national accreditation bodies allow conformity assessment bodies to make use of such flexible scope accreditation, they should indicate it in the accreditation certificate for transparency purposes. To enhance flexibility even where national accreditation bodies do not offer flexible scope accreditation, they should carefully consider, before re-evaluating the accredited conformity assessment body, the impact of the changes to the conformity assessment scheme for which that body has been accredited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(14) To ensure reliability of the conformity assessment schemes, owners should ensure that their conformity assessment schemes do not allow positive certification decisions, or any certificate of conformity, to be issued where the conformity assessment leads to the identification of any non-conformity with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, or with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, with regard to qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust service they provide. Indeed, while conformity assessment reports could include non-conformities and potential remediation plans, no certificate of conformity or positive certification decision should be issued when non-conformities are identified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(15) To ensure transparency in their practices, scheme owners should make publicly available a summary of their conformity assessment schemes. The summary should contain a description of the set of rules and procedures followed for the assessment of the conformity of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and with Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(16) To support the quality, security and reliability of the qualified trust service provider’s activities, the conformity assessment report should identify, where appropriate, opportunities for improvement that could refine the manner in which the qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust services they provide meet the applicable requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(17) To support transparency and to facilitate the verification by supervisory bodies that an assessed qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust services they provide meet the applicable requirements, the conformity assessment report should include certain minimum information. In particular, for the purpose of facilitating the identification of the service entries to be listed in the national trusted list in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, where applicable, a detailed description of the public key infrastructure functional hierarchy, per type of qualified trust service, should be provided in the conformity assessment report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(18) To support transparency and facilitate the verification and monitoring of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, national accreditation bodies should, where applicable, provide an history of the scope of accreditation, including the start and, where applicable, the end date of the accreditation for each qualified trust service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(19) To ensure continuity of conformity assessment bodies that have already been accredited, and to support the transition to the rules laid down in this Regulation, conformity assessment bodies that are currently accredited under standard ETSI EN 319403 version 2.2.2, or an earlier version thereof, would not need to be re-accredited under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 until 17 May 2027. After this date, the conformity assessment bodies should be evaluated by the national accreditation body against the requirements set out in this Regulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(20) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications.
