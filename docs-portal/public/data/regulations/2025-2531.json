The Commission is to establish a list of reference standards and, where necessary, establish specifications for such services.\n\n- (2) An electronic ledger is a sequence of electronic data records which is to ensure the integrity of those data records and the accuracy of the chronological ordering of those records. In order to ensure that the recording of data in a qualified electronic ledger is chronologically ordered, consistent and reliable, it is necessary to establish a common set of specifications for the recording of electronic data in a qualified electronic ledger.\n\n- (3) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 45l(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified trust services for the recording of electronic data in a qualified electronic ledger comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service.\n\n- (4) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (5) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, the Commission should review and, if necessary, update this Regulation, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (6) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span
