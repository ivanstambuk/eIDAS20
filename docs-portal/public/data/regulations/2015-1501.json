Their contribution is explained in the documentation related to the Connecting Europe Facility established by <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"6\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013\" data-celex=\"32013R1316\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013R1316\">Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013</span> of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), including the functions and components of the ‘eIDAS node’.\n\n- (3) Where a Member State or the Commission provides software to enable authentication to a node operated in another Member State, the party which supplies and updates the software used for the authentication mechanism may agree with the party which hosts the software how the operation for the authentication mechanism will be managed.

The results of the mapping shall be notified to the Commission using the notification template laid down in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 (5).\n\n### Article 5\n\n**Nodes**\n\n1. A node in one Member State shall be able to connect with nodes of other Member States.\n\n2. The nodes shall be able to distinguish between public sector bodies and other relying parties through technical means.\n\n3. A Member State implementation of the technical requirements set out in this Regulation shall not impose disproportionate technical requirements and costs on other Member States in order for them to interoperate with the implementation adopted by the first Member State.\n\n### Article 6\n\n**Data privacy and confidentiality**\n\n1. Protection of privacy and confidentiality of the data exchanged and the maintenance of data integrity between the nodes shall be ensured by using best available technical solutions and protection practices.\n\n2. The nodes shall not store any personal data, except for the purpose set out in Article 9(3).\n\n### Article 7\n\n**Data integrity and authenticity for the communication**\n\nCommunication between the nodes shall ensure data integrity and authenticity to make certain that all requests and responses are authentic and have not been tampered with. For this purpose, nodes shall use solutions which have been successfully employed in cross-border operational use.\n\n### Article 8\n\n**Message format for the communication**\n\nThe nodes shall use for syntax common message formats based on standards that have already been deployed more than once between Member States and proven to work in an operational environment. The syntax shall allow:\n\n- (a) proper processing of the minimum set of person identification data uniquely representing a natural or legal person;\n- (b) proper processing of the assurance level of the electronic identification means;\n- (c) distinction between public sector bodies and other relying parties;\n- (d) flexibility to meet the needs of additional attributes relating to identification.\n### Article 9\n\n**Management of security information and metadata**\n\n1. The node operator shall communicate the metadata of the node management in a standardised machine processable manner and in a secure and trustworthy way.\n\n2. At least the parameters relevant to security shall be retrieved automatically.\n\n3. The node operator shall store data which, in the event of an incident, enable reconstruction of the sequence of the message exchange for establishing the place and the nature of the incident. The data shall be stored for a period of time in accordance with national requirements and, as a minimum, shall consist of the following elements:\n\n- (a) node's identification;\n- (b) message identification.\n- (c) message date and time.\n### Article 10\n\n**Information assurance and security standards**\n\n1. Node operators of nodes providing authentication shall prove that, in respect of the nodes participating in the interoperability framework, the node fulfils the requirements of standard ISO/IEC 27001 by certification, or by equivalent methods of assessment, or by complying with national legislation.\n\n2. Node operators shall deploy security critical updates without undue delay.\n\n### Article 11\n\n**Person identification data**\n\n1. A minimum set of person identification data uniquely representing a natural or a legal person shall meet the requirements set out in the Annex when used in a cross-border context.\n\n2. A minimum data set for a natural person representing a legal person shall contain the combination of the attributes listed in the Annex for natural persons and legal persons when used in a cross-border context.\n\n3. Data shall be transmitted based on original characters and, where appropriate, also transliterated into Latin characters.\n\n### Article 12\n\n**Technical specifications**\n\n1. Where it is justified by the process of implementation of the interoperability framework, the Cooperation Network established by Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 may adopt opinions pursuant to Article 14(d) thereof on the need to develop technical specifications. Such technical specifications shall provide further details on technical requirements as set out in this Regulation.\n\n2. Pursuant to the opinion referred to in paragraph 1 the Commission in cooperation with Member States shall develop the technical specifications as part of the digital service infrastructures of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"6\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013\" data-celex=\"32013R1316\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013R1316\">Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013</span>.\n\n3. The Cooperation Network shall adopt an opinion pursuant to Article 14(d) of Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 in which it evaluates whether and to what extent the technical specifications developed under paragraph 2 correspond to the need identified in the opinion referred to in paragraph 1 or the requirements set in this Regulation. It may recommend that Member States take the technical specifications into account when implementing the interoperability framework.\n\n4. The Commission shall provide a reference implementation as an example interpretation of the technical specifications. Member States may apply this reference implementation or use it as a sample when testing other implementations of the technical specifications.\n\n### Article 13\n\n**Dispute resolution**\n\n1. Where possible, any dispute concerning the interoperability framework shall be resolved by the concerned Member States through negotiation.\n\n2. If no solution is reached in accordance with paragraph 1, the Cooperation Network established in accordance with Article 12 of Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 shall have competence in the dispute in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n\n### Article 14\n\n**Entry into force**\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 September 2015.\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 September 2015.\n\n\n---\n\n**For the Commission**\n\nThe President\n**Jean-Claude JUNCKER**\n\n\n---\n\n## ANNEX I\n\n*Requirements concerning the minimum set of person identification data uniquely representing a natural or a legal person, referred to in Article 11*\n\n**1.
