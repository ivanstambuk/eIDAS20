The Commission is to establish a list of reference standards and, where necessary, establish specifications for such services.\n\n- (2) Electronic archiving is a service for the receipt, storage, retrieval and deletion of electronic data and electronic documents to ensure their durability and legibility as well as to preserve their integrity, confidentiality and proof of origin throughout the preservation period. Qualified electronic archiving services play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalents. To ensure that electronic data and electronic documents preserve the presumption of their integrity and of their origin for the duration of the preservation period by the qualified trust service provider, and to achieve a high level of transparency and confidence among all participants in the information lifecycle, it is necessary to establish a common set of specifications for qualified electronic archiving services.\n\n- (3) To increase the evidentiary value, security and trustworthiness of qualified electronic archiving services, where electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time stamps are used to create, sign, seal or attest the date and time of, for example, archiving evidences, evidence records, records of events, records of the correct implementation of procedures, or archiving confirmation reports, qualified trust services should be used.\n\n- (4) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 45j(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified electronic archiving services comply with the requirements set out in this Regulation. The reference standards for qualified electronic archiving services should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified electronic archiving services.\n\n- (5) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (6) In order to preserve the integrity and proof of origin of electronic data and electronic documents containing one or more qualified electronic signatures or seals, qualified electronic archiving services should use procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of those electronic signatures and seals beyond the technological validity period, at least throughout the preservation period.\n\n- (7) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, the Commission should review and, if necessary, update this Regulation, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (8) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\\] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (9) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\\] and delivered its opinion on 21 October 2025 \\[EDPS Formal comments on the draft Implementing Regulation laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards reference standards and specifications for qualified electronic archiving services.\\].\n\n- (10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Electronic archiving of documents bearing a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal**\n\n1.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, providers of qualified electronic archiving services may rely on a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures or on a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals.\n\n### Article 2\n**Reference standards and specifications for the provision of qualified electronic archiving services**\n\nThe reference standards and specifications referred to in Article 45j(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n\n### Article 3\n**Entry into force**\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\n---\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 December 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\n\n# ANNEX\n\n## ANNEX\n\n- (a) Normative references (clause 2)\n- (b) Policy and practice statement (clause 6.1)\n- (c) Terms and Conditions (clause 6.2)\n- (d) Human resources (clause 7.3)\n- (e) Cryptographic controls and monitoring (clause 7.6)\n- (f) Network (clause 7.9)\n- (g) Collection of evidence (clause 7.11)\n- (h) EATSP termination and termination plan (clause 7.13)\n- (i) Reliable time of events (clause 13.3.1)\n\n- (a) Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, as set out in ISO/IEC 15408 or in Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, version CC:2022, Parts 1 through 5, published by the participants of the Arrangement on the Recognition of Common Criteria Certificates in the field of IT Security, and certified to EAL 4 or higher; or\n- (b) the European Common Criteria-based cybersecurity certification scheme (CIR (EU) 2024/482, CIR (EU) 2024/3144) and certified to EAL 4 or higher; or\n- (c) until 31.12.2030, FIPS PUB 140-3 level 3.\n",
