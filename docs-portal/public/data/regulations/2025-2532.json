The Commission is to establish a list of reference standards and, where necessary, establish specifications for such services.\n\n- (2) Electronic archiving is a service for the receipt, storage, retrieval and deletion of electronic data and electronic documents to ensure their durability and legibility as well as to preserve their integrity, confidentiality and proof of origin throughout the preservation period. Qualified electronic archiving services play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalents. To ensure that electronic data and electronic documents preserve the presumption of their integrity and of their origin for the duration of the preservation period by the qualified trust service provider, and to achieve a high level of transparency and confidence among all participants in the information lifecycle, it is necessary to establish a common set of specifications for qualified electronic archiving services.\n\n- (3) To increase the evidentiary value, security and trustworthiness of qualified electronic archiving services, where electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time stamps are used to create, sign, seal or attest the date and time of, for example, archiving evidences, evidence records, records of events, records of the correct implementation of procedures, or archiving confirmation reports, qualified trust services should be used.\n\n- (4) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 45j(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified electronic archiving services comply with the requirements set out in this Regulation. The reference standards for qualified electronic archiving services should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified electronic archiving services.\n\n- (5) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.\n\n- (6) In order to preserve the integrity and proof of origin of electronic data and electronic documents containing one or more qualified electronic signatures or seals, qualified electronic archiving services should use procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of those electronic signatures and seals beyond the technological validity period, at least throughout the preservation period.\n\n- (7) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, the Commission should review and, if necessary, update this Regulation, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.\n\n- (8) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"2\" data-short=\"Regulation 2016/679\" data-celex=\"32016R0679\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\">Regulation 2016/679</span> and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"3\" data-short=\"Directive 2002/58\" data-celex=\"32002L0058\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj\">Directive 2002/58</span> apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.\n\n- (9) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"4\" data-short=\"Regulation 2018/1725\" data-celex=\"32018R1725\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj\">Regulation 2018/1725</span> and delivered its opinion on 21 October 2025 \\[EDPS Formal comments on the draft Implementing Regulation laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards reference standards and specifications for qualified electronic archiving services.\\].\n\n- (10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**\n\n## Enacting Terms\n\n### Article 1\n**Electronic archiving of documents bearing a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal**\n\n1. When archiving electronic data or electronic documents that contain qualified electronic signatures or qualified electronic seals, providers of qualified electronic archiving services shall ensure that the trustworthiness of those qualified electronic signatures or qualified electronic seals is maintained, including beyond their technological validity period, and that the integrity and the accuracy of the origin of the qualified electronic signatures and seals is maintained, at least until the end of the legal or contractual preservation period.\n\n2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, providers of qualified electronic archiving services may rely on a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures or on a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals.\n\n### Article 2\n**Reference standards and specifications for the provision of qualified electronic archiving services**\n\nThe reference standards and specifications referred to in Article 45j(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n\n### Article 3\n**Entry into force**\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\n\n---\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 December 2025.\n\n*For the Commission*\n\n*The President*\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n",
