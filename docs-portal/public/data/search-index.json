Each Member State shall appoint a single national accreditation body. 2. Where a Member State considers that it is not economically meaningful or sustainable to have a national accreditation body or to provide certain accreditation services, it shall, as far as possible, have recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State. 3. A Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States where, in accordance with paragraph 2, recourse is had to the national accreditation body of another Member State. 4. On the basis of the information referred to in paragraph 3 and Article 12, the Commission shall draw up and update a list of national accreditation bodies which it shall make publicly available. 5. Where accreditation is not operated directly by the public authorities themselves, a Member State shall entrust its national accreditation body with the operation of accreditation as a public authority activity and grant it formal recognition. 6. The responsibilities and tasks of the national accreditation body shall be clearly distinguished from those of other national authorities. 7. The national accreditation body shall operate on a not-for-profit basis. 8. The national accreditation body shall not offer or provide any activities or services that conformity assessment bodies provide, nor shall it provide consultancy services, own shares in or otherwise have a financial or managerial interest in a conformity assessment body. 9. Each Member State shall ensure that its national accreditation body has the appropriate financial and personnel resources for the proper performance of its tasks, including the fulfilment of special tasks, such as activities for European and international accreditation cooperation and activities that are required to support public policy and which are not self-financing. 10. The national accreditation body shall be a member of the body recognised under Article 14. 11. National accreditation bodies shall establish and maintain appropriate structures to ensure the effective and balanced involvement of all interested parties within both their organisations and the body recognised under Article 14. ### Article 5 — Operation of accreditation 1. A national accreditation body shall, when requested by a conformity assessment body, evaluate whether that conformity assessment body is competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity. Where it is found to be competent, the national accreditation body shall issue an accreditation certificate to that effect. 2. When a Member State decides not to use accreditation, it shall provide the Commission and the other Member States with all the documentary evidence necessary for the verification of the competence of the conformity assessment bodies it selects for the implementation of the Community harmonisation legislation in question. 3. National accreditation bodies shall monitor the conformity assessment bodies to which they have issued an accreditation certificate. 4. Where a national accreditation body ascertains that a conformity assessment body which has received an accreditation certificate is no longer competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity or has committed a serious breach of its obligations, that accreditation body shall take all appropriate measures within a reasonable timeframe to restrict, suspend or withdraw the accreditation certificate. 5. Member States shall establish procedures for the resolution of appeals, including, where appropriate, legal remedies against accreditation decisions or the absence thereof. ### Article 6 — Principle of non-competition 1. National accreditation bodies shall not compete with conformity assessment bodies. 2. National accreditation bodies shall not compete with other national accreditation bodies. 3. National accreditation bodies shall be permitted to operate across national borders, within the territory of another Member State, either at the request of a conformity assessment body in the circumstances set out in Article 7(1), or, if they are asked to do so by a national accreditation body in accordance with Article 7(3), in cooperation with the national accreditation body of that Member State. ### Article 7 — Cross-border accreditation 1. Where a conformity assessment body requests accreditation it shall do so with the national accreditation body of the Member State in which it is established or with the national accreditation body to which that Member State has had recourse in accordance with Article 4(2). However, a conformity assessment body may request accreditation by a national accreditation body other than those referred to in the first subparagraph in any one of the following situations: (a) where the Member State in which it is established has decided not to establish a national accreditation body and has not had recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State in accordance with Article 4(2)","sourceCount":1},"19":{"id":"term-conformity-assessment","slug":"terminology","type":"definition","term":"conformity assessment","docTitle":"Terminology","section":"Art.

European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93","content":"(Text with EEA relevance) ⚠️ Consolidation Note: This is the consolidated version as of 16 July 2021. Articles 15-29 (Chapter III: Market Surveillance) and several definitions have been repealed by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. Repealed sections are marked with ~~strikethrough~~ or noted as \"[REPEALED]\". THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 95 and 133 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, Preamble Whereas: (1) It is necessary to ensure that products benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Community fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests such as health and safety in general, health and safety at the workplace, protection of consumers, protection of the environment and security, while ensuring that the free movement of products is not restricted to any extent greater than that which is allowed under Community harmonisation legislation or any other relevant Community rules. Provision should, therefore, be made for rules on accreditation, market surveillance, controls of products from third countries and the CE marking. (2) It is necessary to establish an overall framework of rules and principles in relation to accreditation and market surveillance. That framework should not affect the substantive rules of existing legislation setting out the provisions to be observed for the purpose of protecting public interests such as health, safety and protection of consumers and of the environment, but should aim at enhancing their operation. (3) This Regulation should be seen as complementary to Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products. (4) It is very difficult to adopt Community legislation for every product which exists or which may be developed; there is a need for a broad-based, legislative framework of a horizontal nature to deal with such products, to cover lacunae, in particular pending revision of existing specific legislation, and to complement provisions in existing or future specific legislation, in particular with a view to ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, the environment and consumers, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty. (5) The framework for market surveillance established by this Regulation should complement and strengthen existing provisions in Community harmonisation legislation relating to market surveillance and the enforcement of such provisions. However, in accordance with the principle of lex specialis, this Regulation should apply only in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, nature or effect in other existing or future rules of Community harmonisation legislation. Examples can be found in the following sectors: drug precursors, medical devices, medicinal products for human and veterinary use, motor vehicles and aviation. The corresponding provisions of this Regulation should not therefore apply in the areas covered by such specific provisions. (6) Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety established rules to ensure the safety of consumer products. Market surveillance authorities should have the possibility of taking the more specific measures available to them under that Directive. (7) However, in order to achieve a higher level of safety for consumer products, the market surveillance mechanisms provided for in Directive 2001/95/EC should be reinforced as regards products presenting a serious risk, in accordance with the principles established by this Regulation. Directive 2001/95/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. (8) Accreditation is part of an overall system, including conformity assessment and market surveillance, designed to assess and ensure conformity with the applicable requirements. (9) The particular value of accreditation lies in the fact that it provides an authoritative statement of the technical competence of bodies whose task is to ensure conformity with the applicable requirements. (10) Accreditation, though so far not regulated at Community level, is carried out in all Member States. The lack of common rules for that activity has resulted in different approaches and differing systems throughout the Community, with the result that the degree of rigour applied in the performance of accreditation has varied between Member States. It is therefore necessary to develop a comprehensive framework for accreditation and to lay down at Community level the principles for its operation and organisation. (11) The establishment of a uniform national accreditation body should be with"},"110":{"id":"910-2014#article-1","slug":"910-2014","type":"regulation","docTitle":"eIDAS 2.0 Regulation (Consolidated)","section":"Article 1","sectionTitle":"Subject matter","content":"This Regulation aims to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and the provision of an adequate level of security of electronic identification means and trust services used across the Union, in order to enable and facilitate the exercise by natural and legal persons of the right to participate in digital society safely and to access online public and private services throughout the Union.

910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC \\[OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.\\], and in particular Article 24(1c) thereof, Recitals (1) Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 requires that qualified trust service providers verify the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a natural or legal person when issuing qualified certificates or qualified electronic attestations of attributes to that person. (2) In order to ensure equal treatment and ability to trust the result of the verification process, verifications should be carried out in an equivalent manner by all qualified trust service providers when issuing a qualified certificate or a qualified electronic attestation of attributes. In accordance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, a number of standards have been selected to meet these specific requirements. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service, while facilitating cross-border interoperability and the effective functioning of the internal market. (3) An adequate transitional period for qualified trust service providers should be provided for them to be able to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. With a view to ensuring a sufficient timeframe for the audit of trust service providers as regards compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, this Regulation should apply from 24 months as of its entry into force.

These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service and of the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source.

Therefore, qualified trust service providers are only to begin to provide a qualified trust service after the qualified status has been indicated in the trusted lists. (2) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 \\[Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1505/oj).\\] lays down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists. Those specifications and formats leverage the specifications and requirements set out in standard ETSI TS 119 612 version 2.1.1. (3) Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\\] amended Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 by introducing new qualified trust services, namely the management of remote qualified electronic signature creation devices, the management of remote qualified electronic seal creation devices, the issuance of qualified electronic attestation of attributes, the provision of qualified electronic archiving services, and the recording of electronic data in a qualified electronic ledger. Standard ETSI TS 119 612 has been updated to version 2.4.1, and now contains specifications that allow trusted lists to include and indicate the status of those new qualified trust services. The updated version 2.4.1 has also amended the specifications for the format of signatures or seals to be used by Member States to sign or seal their national trusted lists. (4) Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 should be amended to update the reference to standard ETSI TS 119 612 to its newer version 2.4.1. As a result of this amendment, certain additional changes to that Implementing Decision are also required. Firstly, the information, to be referred to in the trusted lists, as regards the interpretation of the content of such lists, should be clarified to allow relying parties to interpret the information in the trusted lists. Secondly, the specifications related to the creation of the electronic signatures or seals that are to be applied to the trusted lists should be adapted to prevent certain known and reported vulnerabilities. (5) To ensure that relying parties have sufficient time to adapt to the specifications set out in the Annex, the application of this Decision should be delayed.

They make it possible to authenticate a website and link the website to the natural or legal person to whom the certificate is issued. The Commission is to establish a list of reference standards for such certificates. (2) The reference standards should allow for the implementation of different types of qualified certificates for website authentication for various use cases, including their use under Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Directive 2015/2366\" data-celex=\"32015L2366\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj\">Directive 2015/2366</span>. They should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. To enable innovation and accommodate diverse technical and operational needs, the reference standards should also allow for issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication in different ways, i.e. as standalone certificates, as certificates bound to other certificates, or in other configurations meeting the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. Such flexibility regarding the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication ensures that the certificates can be adapted to meet the needs of a wide range of use cases, which maintain trust and interoperability across Member States, while not affecting the freedom of providers of web-browsers to ensure web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic in the manner and by the means of technology that they consider to be the most appropriate. (3) With a view to ensuring sufficient time for the audit of qualified trust service providers as regards compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, this Regulation should apply from 12 months as of its entry into force.

with EEA relevance) ⚠️ Consolidation Note: This is the consolidated version as of 16 July 2021. Articles 15-29 (Chapter III: Market Surveillance) and several definitions have been repealed by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. Repealed sections are marked with ~~strikethrough~~ or noted as \"[REPEALED]\". THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 95 and 133 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, Preamble Whereas: (1) It is necessary to ensure that products benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Community fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests such as health and safety in general, health and safety at the workplace, protection of consumers, protection of the environment and security, while ensuring that the free movement of products is not restricted to any extent greater than that which is allowed under Community harmonisation legislation or any other relevant Community rules. Provision should, therefore, be made for rules on accreditation, market surveillance, controls of products from third countries and the CE marking. (2) It is necessary to establish an overall framework of rules and principles in relation to accreditation and market surveillance. That framework should not affect the substantive rules of existing legislation setting out the provisions to be observed for the purpose of protecting public interests such as health, safety and protection of consumers and of the environment, but should aim at enhancing their operation. (3) This Regulation should be seen as complementary to Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products. (4) It is very difficult to adopt Community legislation for every product which exists or which may be developed; there is a need for a broad-based, legislative framework of a horizontal nature to deal with such products, to cover lacunae, in particular pending revision of existing specific legislation, and to complement provisions in existing or future specific legislation, in particular with a view to ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, the environment and consumers, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty. (5) The framework for market surveillance established by this Regulation should complement and strengthen existing provisions in Community harmonisation legislation relating to market surveillance and the enforcement of such provisions. However, in accordance with the principle of lex specialis, this Regulation should apply only in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, nature or effect in other existing or future rules of Community harmonisation legislation. Examples can be found in the following sectors: drug precursors, medical devices, medicinal products for human and veterinary use, motor vehicles and aviation. The corresponding provisions of this Regulation should not therefore apply in the areas covered by such specific provisions. (6) Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety established rules to ensure the safety of consumer products. Market surveillance authorities should have the possibility of taking the more specific measures available to them under that Directive. (7) However, in order to achieve a higher level of safety for consumer products, the market surveillance mechanisms provided for in Directive 2001/95/EC should be reinforced as regards products presenting a serious risk, in accordance with the principles established by this Regulation. Directive 2001/95/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. (8) Accreditation is part of an overall system, including conformity assessment and market surveillance, designed to assess and ensure conformity with the applicable requirements. (9) The particular value of accreditation lies in the fact that it provides an authoritative statement of the technical competence of bodies whose task is to ensure conformity with the applicable requirements. (10) Accreditation, though so far not regulated at Community level, is carried out in all Member States. The lack of common rules for that activity has resulted in different approaches and differing systems throughout the Community, with the result that the degree of rigour applied in the performance of accreditation has varied between Member States. It is therefore necessary to develop a comprehensive framework for accreditation and to lay down at Community level the principles for its operation and organisation.

Scope This Chapter shall apply to accreditation, used on a compulsory or voluntary basis, relating to conformity assessment, whether that assessment is compulsory or not, and irrespective of the legal status of the body performing the accreditation. ### Article 4 — General principles 1. Each Member State shall appoint a single national accreditation body. 2. Where a Member State considers that it is not economically meaningful or sustainable to have a national accreditation body or to provide certain accreditation services, it shall, as far as possible, have recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State. 3. A Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States where, in accordance with paragraph 2, recourse is had to the national accreditation body of another Member State. 4. On the basis of the information referred to in paragraph 3 and Article 12, the Commission shall draw up and update a list of national accreditation bodies which it shall make publicly available. 5. Where accreditation is not operated directly by the public authorities themselves, a Member State shall entrust its national accreditation body with the operation of accreditation as a public authority activity and grant it formal recognition. 6. The responsibilities and tasks of the national accreditation body shall be clearly distinguished from those of other national authorities. 7. The national accreditation body shall operate on a not-for-profit basis. 8. The national accreditation body shall not offer or provide any activities or services that conformity assessment bodies provide, nor shall it provide consultancy services, own shares in or otherwise have a financial or managerial interest in a conformity assessment body. 9. Each Member State shall ensure that its national accreditation body has the appropriate financial and personnel resources for the proper performance of its tasks, including the fulfilment of special tasks, such as activities for European and international accreditation cooperation and activities that are required to support public policy and which are not self-financing. 10. The national accreditation body shall be a member of the body recognised under Article 14. 11. National accreditation bodies shall establish and maintain appropriate structures to ensure the effective and balanced involvement of all interested parties within both their organisations and the body recognised under Article 14. ### Article 5 — Operation of accreditation 1. A national accreditation body shall, when requested by a conformity assessment body, evaluate whether that conformity assessment body is competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity. Where it is found to be competent, the national accreditation body shall issue an accreditation certificate to that effect. 2. When a Member State decides not to use accreditation, it shall provide the Commission and the other Member States with all the documentary evidence necessary for the verification of the competence of the conformity assessment bodies it selects for the implementation of the Community harmonisation legislation in question. 3. National accreditation bodies shall monitor the conformity assessment bodies to which they have issued an accreditation certificate. 4. Where a national accreditation body ascertains that a conformity assessment body which has received an accreditation certificate is no longer competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity or has committed a serious breach of its obligations, that accreditation body shall take all appropriate measures within a reasonable timeframe to restrict, suspend or withdraw the accreditation certificate. 5. Member States shall establish procedures for the resolution of appeals, including, where appropriate, legal remedies against accreditation decisions or the absence thereof. ### Article 6 — Principle of non-competition 1. National accreditation bodies shall not compete with conformity assessment bodies. 2. National accreditation bodies shall not compete with other national accreditation bodies. 3. National accreditation bodies shall be permitted to operate across national borders, within the territory of another Member State, either at the request of a conformity assessment body in the circumstances set out in Article 7(1), or, if they are asked to do so by a national accreditation body in accordance with Article 7(3), in cooperation with the national accreditation body of that Member State. ### Article 7 — Cross-border accreditation 1. Where a conformity assessment body requests accreditation it shall do so with the national accreditation body of the Member State in which it is established or with the national accreditation body to which that Member State has had recourse in accordance with Article 4(2). However, a conformity assessment body may request accreditation by a national accreditation body other than those referred to in the first subparagraph in any one of the following situations: (a) where the Member State in which it is established has decided not to establish a national accreditation body and has not had recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State in accordance with Article 4(2)"],[30,"any content stored in electronic form, in particular text or sound, visual or audiovisual recording"],[57,"any information as defined in Article 4, point (1), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679"],[339,"Any interested party can request, free of charge, current and past information about the scope, start date and, where applicable, end date of the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, for each type of qualified trust service that the conformity assessment body is or has been accredited to assess.

(2) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 \\[Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1505/oj).\\] lays down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists. Those specifications and formats leverage the specifications and requirements set out in standard ETSI TS 119 612 version 2.1.1. (3) Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\\] amended Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 by introducing new qualified trust services, namely the management of remote qualified electronic signature creation devices, the management of remote qualified electronic seal creation devices, the issuance of qualified electronic attestation of attributes, the provision of qualified electronic archiving services, and the recording of electronic data in a qualified electronic ledger. Standard ETSI TS 119 612 has been updated to version 2.4.1, and now contains specifications that allow trusted lists to include and indicate the status of those new qualified trust services. The updated version 2.4.1 has also amended the specifications for the format of signatures or seals to be used by Member States to sign or seal their national trusted lists. (4) Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 should be amended to update the reference to standard ETSI TS 119 612 to its newer version 2.4.1. As a result of this amendment, certain additional changes to that Implementing Decision are also required. Firstly, the information, to be referred to in the trusted lists, as regards the interpretation of the content of such lists, should be clarified to allow relying parties to interpret the information in the trusted lists. Secondly, the specifications related to the creation of the electronic signatures or seals that are to be applied to the trusted lists should be adapted to prevent certain known and reported vulnerabilities. (5) To ensure that relying parties have sufficient time to adapt to the specifications set out in the Annex, the application of this Decision should be delayed. (6) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\\] apply to all personal data processing activities under this Decision.

(2) In order to ensure equal treatment and ability to trust the result of the verification process, verifications should be carried out in an equivalent manner by all qualified trust service providers when issuing a qualified certificate or a qualified electronic attestation of attributes. In accordance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, a number of standards have been selected to meet these specific requirements. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service, while facilitating cross-border interoperability and the effective functioning of the internal market. (3) An adequate transitional period for qualified trust service providers should be provided for them to be able to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.
