Digital communication, social media interaction, e-commerce, and digital enterprises are steadily transforming our world. They are generating an ever-increasing amount of data, which, if pooled and used, can lead to a completely new means and levels of value creation. It is a transformation as fundamental as that caused by the industrial revolution. In her political guidelines, Commission President von der Leyen stressed the need for Europe to lead the transition to a healthy planet and a new digital world. This twin challenge of a green and digital transformation has to go hand-in-hand. It requires, as set out in the European Green Deal, an immediate change of direction towards more sustainable solutions which are resource-efficient, circular and climate-neutral. It requires that every citizen, every employee, every business person has a fair chance, wherever they live, to reap the benefits of our increasingly digitised society. Digital solutions such as communications systems, artificial intelligence or quantum technologies can enrich our lives in many ways. But the benefits arising from digital technologies do not come without risks and costs. Citizens no longer feel in control over what happens with their personal data and are increasingly overloaded by artificial solicitations of their attention. And malicious cyberactivity may threaten our personal well-being or disrupt our critical infrastructures and wider security interests. This substantive societal transformation calls for a profound reflection at all levels of society as to how Europe can best meet, and continue to meet, these risks and challenges. It will require a huge effort, but Europe undoubtedly has the means to bring about this better digital future for everyone. Our Vision and Goals The Commission wants a European society powered by digital solutions that are strongly rooted in our common values, and that enrich the lives of all of us: people must have the opportunity to develop personally, to choose freely and safely, to engage in society, regardless of their age, gender or professional background. Businesses need a framework that allows them to start up, scale up, pool and use data, to innovate and compete or cooperate on fair terms. And Europe needs to have a choice and pursue the digital transformation in its own way. European technological sovereignty starts from ensuring the integrity and resilience of our data infrastructure, networks and communications. It requires creating the right conditions for Europe to develop and deploy its own key capacities, thereby reducing our dependency on other parts of the globe for the most crucial technologies. Europe's ability to define its own rules and values in the digital age will be reinforced by such capacities. European technological sovereignty is not defined against anyone else, but by focusing on the needs of Europeans and of the European social model. The EU will remain open to anyone willing to play by European rules and meet European standards, regardless of where they are based. Citizens should be empowered to make better decisions based on insights gleaned from non-personal data. And that data should be available to all – whether public or private, big or small, start-up or giant. This will help society to get the most out of innovation and competition and ensure that everyone benefits from a digital dividend. This digital Europe should reflect the best of Europe - open, fair, diverse, democratic, and confident. For the next five years, the Commission will focus on three key objectives to ensure that digital solutions help Europe to pursue its own way towards a digital transformation that works for the benefit of people through respecting our values. It will also put Europe in a position to be a trendsetter in the global debate. Three Key Objectives Technology that works for people: Development, deployment and uptake of technology that makes a real difference to people's daily lives. A strong and competitive economy that masters and shapes technology in a way that respects European values. A fair and competitive economy: A frictionless single market, where companies of all sizes and in any sector can compete on equal terms, and can develop, market and use digital technologies, products and services at a scale that boosts their productivity and global competitiveness, and consumers can be confident that their rights are respected. An open, democratic and sustainable society: A trustworthy environment in which citizens are empowered in how they act and interact, and of the data they provide both online and offline.

Digital technologies are now imperative for working, learning, entertaining, socialising, shopping and accessing everything from health services to culture. It has also shown the decisive role that disruptive innovation can play. The pandemic has also exposed the vulnerabilities of our digital space, its dependencies on non-European technologies, and the impact of disinformation on our democratic societies. In the light of these challenges, our stated ambition is more relevant than ever: to pursue digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize a human centred, sustainable and more prosperous digital future. Europe will have to build on its strengths – an open and competitive single market, strong rules embedding European values, being an assertive player in fair and rule-based international trade, its solid industrial base, highly-skilled citizens and a robust civil society. At the same time, it needs to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions and will need to accelerate associated investment. That is the way for Europe to be digitally sovereign in an interconnected world by building and deploying technological capabilities in a way that empowers people and businesses to seize the potential of the digital transformation, and helps build a healthier and greener society. In the State of the Union Address in September 2020, President von der Leyen announced that Europe should secure digital sovereignty with a common vision of the EU in 2030, based on clear goals and principles. The President put special emphasis on a European Cloud, leadership in ethical artificial intelligence, a secure digital identity for all, and vastly improved data, supercomputer and connectivity infrastructures. In response, the European Council invited the Commission to present a comprehensive Digital Compass by March 2021, setting out digital ambitions for 2030, establishing a monitoring system and outlining key milestones and the means of achieving these ambitions. This political impetus calls for an intensification of the work begun in the past decade to accelerate Europe's digital transformation – building on progress towards a fully functioning Digital Single Market, and intensifying actions defined in the strategy for Shaping Europe's digital future. The strategy set out a programme of policy reform, which have started already with the Data Governance Act, the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Cybersecurity Strategy. A number of Union budget instruments will support the investments necessary for the digital transition, including the Cohesion programmes, the Technical Support Instrument, and the Digital Europe Programme. The agreement by the co-legislators that a minimum of 20% of the Recovery and Resilience Facility should support the digital transition and will help underpin this reform agenda, with funding to build Europe's Digital Decade on solid foundations. The European way: vision for 2030 By 2030 we want a Europe that is by all measures, digitally sovereign in an open and interconnected world, pursuing digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize a human-centred, sustainable and more prosperous digital future. Transition to a sustainable economy requires smarter management of product-related data across the product lifecycle. Most of this information exists, but is not available to those that could use it best. Digital technologies provide the possibility to tag, trace, localise and share product related data along value chains, down to the level of the individual components and materials. Starting with batteries for electric vehicles and industrial applications, the European digital product passport (as part of the Sustainable Products Initiative) will improve information available to business, boost resource efficiency and empower consumers to make sustainable choices. Resilient, secure and trustworthy infrastructures and technologies are indispensable to ensure the respect of European rules and values. A strong single market, fair competition and a functioning rules-based trade are critical assets for the EU's economic success and resilience. At the same time, digital technologies are mostly developed outside the EU and the convergence across Member States on digitalisation remains limited, hampering economies of scale. The EU will be a stronger international partner thanks to reinforced internal strengths and capacities.

(4) The Commission Communication '2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade' \\[COM(2021) 118 final.\\] sets the objective that, by 2030, the Union and its citizens should benefit from a wide deployment of a trusted, user-controlled identity, allowing each user to control their own online interactions and presence. (5) The Commission adopted a proposal to amend the eIDAS Regulation \\[COM(2021) 281 final.\\]. It proposes a European Digital Identity framework to offer users self-determined personal digital wallets that would allow for a secure and easy access to different services, both public and private, under the users full control. In addition, it creates a new qualified trust service for attestation of attributes concerning information related to identity, such as addresses, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, educational and professional qualifications and titles, licenses, other permits and payment data, that can be offered, shared and exchanged across borders, in full security, data protection and with legal effect across borders. (6) Given the acceleration of digitisation, Member States have deployed or are developing national electronic identity systems including digital wallets and national trust frameworks for the integration of attributes and credentials. Other solutions are being prepared or in the process of being deployed by private sector operators. (7) The development of divergent national solutions creates fragmentation and deprives people and businesses from the benefits of the Single Market, as they cannot use secure, convenient and uniform identification systems across the Union to access both public and private services. (8) To support the competitiveness of European businesses, online service providers should be able to rely on digital identity solutions recognised across the Union, irrespective of the Member State in which they have been issued, thus benefiting from a harmonised European approach to trust, security and interoperability. Users and service providers alike should be able to benefit from the same legal value provided to electronic attestations of attributes valid across the Union. (9) In order to avoid fragmentation and barriers due to diverging standards, and to ensure a coordinated process to impede endangering the implementation of the future European Digital Identity framework, there needs to be a process for close and structured cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and the private sector. (10) To accelerate the path towards achieving this objective, Member States should increase their cooperation and identify a Toolbox for a European Digital Identity framework. The toolbox should lead to a technical architecture and reference framework, a set of common standards and technical references as well as best practices and guidelines as a basis for the implementation of the European Digital Identity framework. To ensure a harmonised approach for electronic identity in line with the expectations of citizens and businesses, including of persons with disabilities, cooperation should start immediately in parallel and in full respect of the legislative process and in alignment with its outcome. (11) This Recommendation sets up a structured process of cooperation between Membe"},"707":{"id":"2022-2481","slug":"2022-2481","type":"regulation","docTitle":"Digital Decade Programme","section":"Digital Decade Programme","sectionTitle":"Decision (EU) 2022/2481: Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030","content":"Official Journal of the European Union L 323/4 19 December 2022 DECISION (EU) 2022/2481 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2022 establishing the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 (Text with EEA relevance) Preamble THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 173(3) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Recitals (1) In its communication of 9 March 2021 entitled '2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade' the Commission laid out its vision for 2030 to empower citizens and businesses through digital transformation. The Union's path to the digital transformation should encompass digital sovereignty in an open manner, respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy, inclusion, accessibility, equality, sustainability, resilience, security, improving quality of life, the availability of services and respect for citizens' rights and aspirations. (2) The digital transformation is not possible without strong support for science, research, development and the scientific community. Since the degree of digitalisation of the economy or society is a critical underpinning of economic and societal resilience as well as a factor in their global influence, it is necessary for the Union's international action to structure the broad range of existing cooperation in line with the pillars of the Digital Decade. (3) In a statement of 25 March 2021, the European Council considered the Digital Compass Communication to be a step towards charting the Union's digital development for the next decade and confirmed the vision set out therein, including the idea of a policy programme with an efficient governance framework. (8) The measures envisaged in the Digital Compass Communication should be implemented, building on existing Union instruments, such as programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, the Technical Support Instrument, and the Digital Europe Programme. (10) In order to follow the trajectory of the Union regarding the pace of the digital transformation, digital targets should be established at Union level. Those digital targets should be linked to concrete areas: digital skills, digital infrastructures, the digitalisation of businesses, and the digitalisation of public services. Chapter I — General Provisions Article 1 — Subject matter This Decision establishes the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 and lays down: (a) the direction for the Union for the digital transformation towards achieving the general objectives and the digital targets; (b) a structured framework for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States; (c) a monitoring and reporting mechanism; (d) multi-country projects.

General Questions What is an electronic signature? An electronic signature is a data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign, where the signatory is a natural person. Like its handwritten counterpart in the offline world, an electronic signature can be used, for instance, to electronically indicate that the signatory has written the document, agreed with the content of the document, or that the signatory was present as a witness. In case you want to seal a document as a legal person (e.g. as a business or organisation), you might be instead interested in an electronic seal. What is an electronic seal? An electronic seal is a data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter's origin and integrity, where the creator of a seal is a legal person (unlike the electronic signature that is issued by a natural person). In this purpose, electronic seals might serve as evidence that an electronic document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the document's origin and integrity. Nevertheless, across the European Union, when a transaction requires a qualified electronic seal from a legal person, a qualified electronic signature from the authorised representative of the legal person is equally acceptable. What is the difference between an electronic signature and a digital signature? An 'electronic signature' is a legal concept that is defined in eIDAS by the following: \"'electronic signature' means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign;\" (eIDAS Article 3.10) A digital signature, on the other hand, refers to a mathematical and cryptographic concept that is widely used to provide concrete and practical instances of electronic signature. The definition given by ETSI TR 119 100 is that of data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation of a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery e.g. by the recipient. These two concepts should be distinguished, as all electronic signatures are not necessarily digital signatures. What are the levels (simple, advanced and qualified) of electronic signatures? The eIDAS Regulation defines three levels of electronic signature: 'simple' electronic signature, advanced electronic signature and qualified electronic signature. The requirements of each level are built on the requirements of the level below it, such that a qualified electronic signature meets the most requirements and a 'simple' electronic signature the least. 'Simple' electronic signatures An electronic signature is defined as \"data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign\". Thus, something as simple as writing your name under an e-mail might constitute an electronic signature. Advanced electronic signatures (AdES) An advanced electronic signature is an electronic signature which is additionally: uniquely linked to and capable of identifying the signatory; created in a way that allows the signatory to retain control; linked to the document in a way that any subsequent change of the data is detectable. The most commonly used technology able to provide these requirements relies on the use of a public-key infrastructure (PKI), which involves the use of certificates and cryptographic keys. Qualified electronic signatures (QES) A qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature which is additionally: created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD); and is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. What are the levels (simple, advanced and qualified) of electronic seals? Like the electronic signature, the eIDAS Regulation defines three levels of electronic seal: 'simple' electronic seal, advanced electronic seal and qualified electronic seal. The requirements of each level are built on the requirements of the level below it, such that a qualified electronic seal meets the most requirements and a 'simple' electronic seal the least. Nevertheless, levels of electronic seals don't have the same definitions, requirements, nor legal effects than levels of electronic signatures: 'Simple' electronic seals An electronic seal is defined as \"data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter's origin and integrity\". Advanced electronic seals (AdES) An advanced electronic seal is an electronic seal which is additionally: uniquely linked to the creator of the seal; capable of identifying the creator of the seal; created using ele"},"821":{"id":"2024-2977#article-1","slug":"2024-2977","type":"implementing-act","docTitle":"PID & EAA","section":"Article 1","sectionTitle":"Subject matter and

transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalents. By binding date and time information to electronic data, qualified electronic time stamps help ensuring the accuracy of date and time they indicate and the integrity of digital documents to which the date and time are bound.

These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service and of the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source. (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"11\" data-short=\"Regulation (EU) No 910/2014\" data-celex=\"32014R0910\" data-internal=\"true\" data-url=\"#/regulation/2014-910\">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</span> and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service.

Standard ETSI TS 119 612 has been updated to version 2.4.1, and now contains specifications that allow trusted lists to include and indicate the status of those new qualified trust services. The updated version 2.4.1 has also amended the specifications for the format of signatures or seals to be used by Member States to sign or seal their national trusted lists. (4) Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 should be amended to update the reference to standard ETSI TS 119 612 to its newer version 2.4.1. As a result of this amendment, certain additional changes to that Implementing Decision are also required. Firstly, the information, to be referred to in the trusted lists, as regards the interpretation of the content of such lists, should be clarified to allow relying parties to interpret the information in the trusted lists. Secondly, the specifications related to the creation of the electronic signatures or seals that are to be applied to the trusted lists should be adapted to prevent certain known and reported vulnerabilities. (5) To ensure that relying parties have sufficient time to adapt to the specifications set out in the Annex, the application of this Decision should be delayed.

They make it possible to authenticate a website and link the website to the natural or legal person to whom the certificate is issued. The Commission is to establish a list of reference standards for such certificates. (2) The reference standards should allow for the implementation of different types of qualified certificates for website authentication for various use cases, including their use under Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council <span class=\"citation-ref\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-idx=\"1\" data-short=\"Directive 2015/2366\" data-celex=\"32015L2366\" data-internal=\"false\" data-url=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj\">Directive 2015/2366</span>.

Such flexibility regarding the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication ensures that the certificates can be adapted to meet the needs of a wide range of use cases, which maintain trust and interoperability across Member States, while not affecting the freedom of providers of web-browsers to ensure web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic in the manner and by the means of technology that they consider to be the most appropriate. (3) With a view to ensuring sufficient time for the audit of qualified trust service providers as regards compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, this Regulation should apply from 12 months as of its entry into force.

Digital communication, social media interaction, e-commerce, and digital enterprises are steadily transforming our world. They are generating an ever-increasing amount of data, which, if pooled and used, can lead to a completely new means and levels of value creation. It is a transformation as fundamental as that caused by the industrial revolution. In her political guidelines, Commission President von der Leyen stressed the need for Europe to lead the transition to a healthy planet and a new digital world. This twin challenge of a green and digital transformation has to go hand-in-hand. It requires, as set out in the European Green Deal, an immediate change of direction towards more sustainable solutions which are resource-efficient, circular and climate-neutral. It requires that every citizen, every employee, every business person has a fair chance, wherever they live, to reap the benefits of our increasingly digitised society. Digital solutions such as communications systems, artificial intelligence or quantum technologies can enrich our lives in many ways. But the benefits arising from digital technologies do not come without risks and costs. Citizens no longer feel in control over what happens with their personal data and are increasingly overloaded by artificial solicitations of their attention. And malicious cyberactivity may threaten our personal well-being or disrupt our critical infrastructures and wider security interests. This substantive societal transformation calls for a profound reflection at all levels of society as to how Europe can best meet, and continue to meet, these risks and challenges. It will require a huge effort, but Europe undoubtedly has the means to bring about this better digital future for everyone. Our Vision and Goals The Commission wants a European society powered by digital solutions that are strongly rooted in our common values, and that enrich the lives of all of us: people must have the opportunity to develop personally, to choose freely and safely, to engage in society, regardless of their age, gender or professional background. Businesses need a framework that allows them to start up, scale up, pool and use data, to innovate and compete or cooperate on fair terms. And Europe needs to have a choice and pursue the digital transformation in its own way. European technological sovereignty starts from ensuring the integrity and resilience of our data infrastructure, networks and communications. It requires creating the right conditions for Europe to develop and deploy its own key capacities, thereby reducing our dependency on other parts of the globe for the most crucial technologies. Europe's ability to define its own rules and values in the digital age will be reinforced by such capacities. European technological sovereignty is not defined against anyone else, but by focusing on the needs of Europeans and of the European social model. The EU will remain open to anyone willing to play by European rules and meet European standards, regardless of where they are based. Citizens should be empowered to make better decisions based on insights gleaned from non-personal data. And that data should be available to all – whether public or private, big or small, start-up or giant. This will help society to get the most out of innovation and competition and ensure that everyone benefits from a digital dividend. This digital Europe should reflect the best of Europe - open, fair, diverse, democratic, and confident. For the next five years, the Commission will focus on three key objectives to ensure that digital solutions help Europe to pursue its own way towards a digital transformation that works for the benefit of people through respecting our values. It will also put Europe in a position to be a trendsetter in the global debate. Three Key Objectives Technology that works for people: Development, deployment and uptake of technology that makes a real difference to people's daily lives. A strong and competitive economy that masters and shapes technology in a way that respects European values. A fair and competitive economy: A frictionless single market, where companies of all sizes and in any sector can compete on equal terms, and can develop, market and use digital technologies, products and services at a scale that boosts their productivity and global competitiveness, and consumers can be confident that their rights are respected. An open, democratic and sustainable society: A trustworthy environment in which citizens are empowered in how they act and interact, and of the data they provide both online and offline.

Digital technologies are now imperative for working, learning, entertaining, socialising, shopping and accessing everything from health services to culture. It has also shown the decisive role that disruptive innovation can play. The pandemic has also exposed the vulnerabilities of our digital space, its dependencies on non-European technologies, and the impact of disinformation on our democratic societies. In the light of these challenges, our stated ambition is more relevant than ever: to pursue digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize a human centred, sustainable and more prosperous digital future. Europe will have to build on its strengths – an open and competitive single market, strong rules embedding European values, being an assertive player in fair and rule-based international trade, its solid industrial base, highly-skilled citizens and a robust civil society. At the same time, it needs to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions and will need to accelerate associated investment. That is the way for Europe to be digitally sovereign in an interconnected world by building and deploying technological capabilities in a way that empowers people and businesses to seize the potential of the digital transformation, and helps build a healthier and greener society. In the State of the Union Address in September 2020, President von der Leyen announced that Europe should secure digital sovereignty with a common vision of the EU in 2030, based on clear goals and principles. The President put special emphasis on a European Cloud, leadership in ethical artificial intelligence, a secure digital identity for all, and vastly improved data, supercomputer and connectivity infrastructures. In response, the European Council invited the Commission to present a comprehensive Digital Compass by March 2021, setting out digital ambitions for 2030, establishing a monitoring system and outlining key milestones and the means of achieving these ambitions. This political impetus calls for an intensification of the work begun in the past decade to accelerate Europe's digital transformation – building on progress towards a fully functioning Digital Single Market, and intensifying actions defined in the strategy for Shaping Europe's digital future. The strategy set out a programme of policy reform, which have started already with the Data Governance Act, the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Cybersecurity Strategy. A number of Union budget instruments will support the investments necessary for the digital transition, including the Cohesion programmes, the Technical Support Instrument, and the Digital Europe Programme. The agreement by the co-legislators that a minimum of 20% of the Recovery and Resilience Facility should support the digital transition and will help underpin this reform agenda, with funding to build Europe's Digital Decade on solid foundations. The European way: vision for 2030 By 2030 we want a Europe that is by all measures, digitally sovereign in an open and interconnected world, pursuing digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize a human-centred, sustainable and more prosperous digital future. Transition to a sustainable economy requires smarter management of product-related data across the product lifecycle. Most of this information exists, but is not available to those that could use it best. Digital technologies provide the possibility to tag, trace, localise and share product related data along value chains, down to the level of the individual components and materials. Starting with batteries for electric vehicles and industrial applications, the European digital product passport (as part of the Sustainable Products Initiative) will improve information available to business, boost resource efficiency and empower consumers to make sustainable choices. Resilient, secure and trustworthy infrastructures and technologies are indispensable to ensure the respect of European rules and values. A strong single market, fair competition and a functioning rules-based trade are critical assets for the EU's economic success and resilience. At the same time, digital technologies are mostly developed outside the EU and the convergence across Member States on digitalisation remains limited, hampering economies of scale. The EU will be a stronger international partner thanks to reinforced internal strengths and capacities.

General Questions What is an electronic signature? An electronic signature is a data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign, where the signatory is a natural person. Like its handwritten counterpart in the offline world, an electronic signature can be used, for instance, to electronically indicate that the signatory has written the document, agreed with the content of the document, or that the signatory was present as a witness. In case you want to seal a document as a legal person (e.g. as a business or organisation), you might be instead interested in an electronic seal. What is an electronic seal? An electronic seal is a data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter's origin and integrity, where the creator of a seal is a legal person (unlike the electronic signature that is issued by a natural person). In this purpose, electronic seals might serve as evidence that an electronic document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the document's origin and integrity. Nevertheless, across the European Union, when a transaction requires a qualified electronic seal from a legal person, a qualified electronic signature from the authorised representative of the legal person is equally acceptable. What is the difference between an electronic signature and a digital signature? An 'electronic signature' is a legal concept that is defined in eIDAS by the following: \"'electronic signature' means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign;\" (eIDAS Article 3.10) A digital signature, on the other hand, refers to a mathematical and cryptographic concept that is widely used to provide concrete and practical instances of electronic signature. The definition given by ETSI TR 119 100 is that of data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation of a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery e.g. by the recipient. These two concepts should be distinguished, as all electronic signatures are not necessarily digital signatures. What are the levels (simple, advanced and qualified) of electronic signatures? The eIDAS Regulation defines three levels of electronic signature: 'simple' electronic signature, advanced electronic signature and qualified electronic signature. The requirements of each level are built on the requirements of the level below it, such that a qualified electronic signature meets the most requirements and a 'simple' electronic signature the least. 'Simple' electronic signatures An electronic signature is defined as \"data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign\". Thus, something as simple as writing your name under an e-mail might constitute an electronic signature. Advanced electronic signatures (AdES) An advanced electronic signature is an electronic signature which is additionally: uniquely linked to and capable of identifying the signatory; created in a way that allows the signatory to retain control; linked to the document in a way that any subsequent change of the data is detectable. The most commonly used technology able to provide these requirements relies on the use of a public-key infrastructure (PKI), which involves the use of certificates and cryptographic keys. Qualified electronic signatures (QES) A qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature which is additionally: created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD); and is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. What are the levels (simple, advanced and qualified) of electronic seals? Like the electronic signature, the eIDAS Regulation defines three levels of electronic seal: 'simple' electronic seal, advanced electronic seal and qualified electronic seal. The requirements of each level are built on the requirements of the level below it, such that a qualified electronic seal meets the most requirements and a 'simple' electronic seal the least. Nevertheless, levels of electronic seals don't have the same definitions, requirements, nor legal effects than levels of electronic signatures: 'Simple' electronic seals An electronic seal is defined as \"data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter's origin and integrity\". Advanced electronic seals (AdES) An advanced electronic seal is an electronic seal which is additionally: uniquely linked to the creator of the seal; capable of identifying the creator of the seal; created using ele"],[230,"hardware or software, or relevant components of hardware or software, which are intended to be used for the provision of electronic identification and trust services | any industrially manufactured product and any agricultural product, including fish products"],[132,"HSM A physical computing device that safeguards and manages cryptographic keys, performs encryption and decryption functions, and provides strong authentication.

The Union's path to the digital transformation should encompass digital sovereignty in an open manner, respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy, inclusion, accessibility, equality, sustainability, resilience, security, improving quality of life, the availability of services and respect for citizens' rights and aspirations. (2) The digital transformation is not possible without strong support for science, research, development and the scientific community. Since the degree of digitalisation of the economy or society is a critical underpinning of economic and societal resilience as well as a factor in their global influence, it is necessary for the Union's international action to structure the broad range of existing cooperation in line with the pillars of the Digital Decade. (3) In a statement of 25 March 2021, the European Council considered the Digital Compass Communication to be a step towards charting the Union's digital development for the next decade and confirmed the vision set out therein, including the idea of a policy programme with an efficient governance framework. (8) The measures envisaged in the Digital Compass Communication should be implemented, building on existing Union instruments, such as programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, the Technical Support Instrument, and the Digital Europe Programme. (10) In order to follow the trajectory of the Union regarding the pace of the digital transformation, digital targets should be established at Union level. Those digital targets should be linked to concrete areas: digital skills, digital infrastructures, the digitalisation of businesses, and the digitalisation of public services. Chapter I — General Provisions Article 1 — Subject matter This Decision establishes the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 and lays down: (a) the direction for the Union for the digital transformation towards achieving the general objectives and the digital targets; (b) a structured framework for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States; (c) a monitoring and reporting mechanism; (d) multi-country projects. Article 2 — Definitions For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions apply: (1) 'Digital Economy and Society Index' or 'DESI' means an annual set of analysis and measurement indicators used for monitoring the Union's overall and the Member States' digital performance across various policy dimensions, including digital skills, the rollout of digital infrastructure, the digitalisation of businesses and public services, which underpins the monitoring of the digital targets; (2) 'multi-country projects' means large-scale projects identified in accordance with Article 12 that facilitate the achievement of the digital targets, including Union and Member State financing, in accordance with Article 10; (3) 'statistics' means statistics as defined in Article 3, point (1), of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009; (4) 'peer review process' means a mechanism whereby Member States exchange best practices on specific aspects of the policies, measures and actions proposed by a given Member State; (5) 'projected trajectory' means the projected path per digital target until 2030, to achieve the digital targets, on the basis of historical data where available; (6) 'edge nodes' means distributed data-processing capacity connected to the network and located close to or in the physical endpoint where the data is generated, which offers distributed computing and storage capabilities for low-latency data processing; (7) 'digital intensity' means the aggregated value attributed to an undertaking, on the basis of the number of technologies it uses, against a scoreboard of various technologies, in line with DESI; (8) 'key public services' means essential services provided by public entities to natural persons in their major life events and to legal persons in their professional life-cycle; (9) 'advanced digital skills' means skills and professional competen"],[352,"one or more sequences of actions required to produce an outcome that complies with governing rules of an electronic ledger"],[218,"PDF advanced electronic signature (PAdES), based on PDF signatures.

In a response to the increased digitalisation of services, the demand by users and business for means to identify and authenticate online, as well as to digitally exchange information related to identity, attributes or qualifications, in a secure way and with a high level of data protection, has increased radically. (2) The objective of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council \\[Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC (OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73).\\] (the 'eIDAS Regulation') is to enable the cross-border recognition of government electronic identification ('eIDs') to access public services, and to establish a Union market for trust services recognised across borders with the same legal status as the traditional equivalent paper-based processes. (3) In its conclusions of 1-2 October 2020, the European Council called on the Commission to make a proposal for the development of an EU-wide framework for secure public electronic identification, including interoperable digital signatures, to provide people with control over their online identity and data as well as to enable access to public, private and cross-border digital services. (4) The Commission Communication '2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade' \\[COM(2021) 118 final.\\] sets the objective that, by 2030, the Union and its citizens should benefit from a wide deployment of a trusted, user-controlled identity, allowing each user to control their own online interactions and presence. (5) The Commission adopted a proposal to amend the eIDAS Regulation \\[COM(2021) 281 final.\\]. It proposes a European Digital Identity framework to offer users self-determined personal digital wallets that would allow for a secure and easy access to different services, both public and private, under the users full control. In addition, it creates a new qualified trust service for attestation of attributes concerning information related to identity, such as addresses, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, educational and professional qualifications and titles, licenses, other permits and payment data, that can be offered, shared and exchanged across borders, in full security, data protection and with legal effect across borders. (6) Given the acceleration of digitisation, Member States have deployed or are developing national electronic identity systems including digital wallets and national trust frameworks for the integration of attributes and credentials. Other solutions are being prepared or in the process of being deployed by private sector operators. (7) The development of divergent national solutions creates fragmentation and deprives people and businesses from the benefits of the Single Market, as they cannot use secure, convenient and uniform identification systems across the Union to access both public and private services. (8) To support the competitiveness of European businesses, online service providers should be able to rely on digital identity solutions recognised across the Union, irrespective of the Member State in which they have been issued, thus benefiting from a harmonised European approach to trust, security and interoperability. Users and service providers alike should be able to benefit from the same legal value provided to electronic attestations of attributes valid across the Union. (9) In order to avoid fragmentation and barriers due to diverging standards, and to ensure a coordinated process to impede endangering the implementation of the future European Digital Identity framework, there needs to be a process for close and structured cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and the private sector. (10) To accelerate the path towards achieving this objective, Member States should increase their cooperation and identify a Toolbox for a European Digital Identity framework. The toolbox should lead to a technical architecture and reference framework, a set of common standards and technical references as well as best practices and guidelines as a basis for the implementation of the European Digital Identity framework. To ensure a harmonised approach for electronic identity in line with the expectations of citizens and businesses, including of persons with disabilities, cooperation should start immediately in parallel and in full respect of the legislative process and in alignment with its outcome.

Standard ETSI TS 119 612 has been updated to version 2.4.1, and now contains specifications that allow trusted lists to include and indicate the status of those new qualified trust services. The updated version 2.4.1 has also amended the specifications for the format of signatures or seals to be used by Member States to sign or seal their national trusted lists. (4) Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 should be amended to update the reference to standard ETSI TS 119 612 to its newer version 2.4.1. As a result of this amendment, certain additional changes to that Implementing Decision are also required. Firstly, the information, to be referred to in the trusted lists, as regards the interpretation of the content of such lists, should be clarified to allow relying parties to interpret the information in the trusted lists. Secondly, the specifications related to the creation of the electronic signatures or seals that are to be applied to the trusted lists should be adapted to prevent certain known and reported vulnerabilities. (5) To ensure that relying parties have sufficient time to adapt to the specifications set out in the Annex, the application of this Decision should be delayed.
