# COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2018/389

## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 98(4) thereof,*

Whereas:

## Recitals

- (1) Payment services offered electronically should be carried out in a secure manner, adopting technologies able to guarantee the safe authentication of the user and to reduce, to the maximum extent possible, the risk of fraud. The authentication procedure should include, in general, transaction monitoring mechanisms to detect attempts to use a payment service user's personalised security credentials that were lost, stolen, or misappropriated and should also ensure that the payment service user is the legitimate user and therefore is giving consent for the transfer of funds and access to its account information through a normal use of the personalised security credentials. Furthermore, it is necessary to specify the requirements of the strong customer authentication that should be applied each time a payer accesses its payment account online, initiates an electronic payment transaction or carries out any action through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuse, by requiring the generation of an authentication code which should be resistant against the risk of being forged in its entirety or by disclosure of any of the elements upon which the code was generated.

- (2) As fraud methods are constantly changing, the requirements of strong customer authentication should allow for innovation in the technical solutions addressing the emergence of new threats to the security of electronic payments. To ensure that the requirements to be laid down are effectively implemented on a continuous basis, it is also appropriate to require that the security measures for the application of strong customer authentication and its exemptions, the measures to protect confidentiality and integrity of the personalised security credentials, and the measures establishing common and secure open standards of communication are documented, periodically tested, evaluated and audited by auditors with expertise in IT security and payments and operationally independent. In order to allow competent authorities to monitor the quality of the review of these measures, such reviews should be made available to them upon their request.

- (3) As electronic remote payment transactions are subject to a higher risk of fraud, it is necessary to introduce additional requirements for the strong customer authentication of such transactions, ensuring that the elements dynamically link the transaction to an amount and a payee specified by the payer when initiating the transaction.

- (4) Dynamic linking is possible through the generation of authentication codes which is subject to a set of strict security requirements. To remain technologically neutral a specific technology for the implementation of authentication codes should not be required. Therefore authentication codes should be based on solutions such as generating and validating one-time passwords, digital signatures or other cryptographically underpinned validity assertions using keys or cryptographic material stored in the authentication elements, as long as the security requirements are fulfilled.

- (5) It is necessary to lay down specific requirements for the situation where the final amount is not known at the moment the payer initiates an electronic remote payment transaction, in order to ensure that the strong customer authentication is specific to the maximum amount that the payer has given consent for as referred to in Directive (EU) 2015/2366.

- (6) In order to ensure the application of strong customer authentication, it is also necessary to require adequate security features for the elements of strong customer authentication categorised as ‘knowledge’ (something only the user knows), such as length or complexity, for the elements categorised as ‘possession’ (something only the user possesses), such as algorithm specifications, key length and information entropy, and for the devices and software that read elements categorised as ‘inherence’ (something the user is) such as algorithm specifications, biometric sensor and template protection features, in particular to mitigate the risk that those elements are uncovered, disclosed to and used by unauthorised parties. It is also necessary to lay down the requirements to ensure that those elements are independent, so that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, in particular when any of these elements are used through a multi-purpose device,namely a device such as a tablet or a mobile phone which can be used both for giving the instruction to make the payment and in the authentication process.

- (7) The requirements of strong customer authentication apply to payments initiated by the payer, regardless of whether the payer is a natural person or a legal entity.

- (8) Due to their very nature, payments made through the use of an anonymous payment instruments are not subject to the obligation of strong customer authentication. Where the anonymity of such instruments is lifted on contractual or legislative grounds, payments are subject to the security requirements that follow from Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and this Regulatory Technical Standard.

- (9) In accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/2366, exemptions to the principle of strong customer authentication have been defined based on the level of risk, amount, recurrence and the payment channel used for the execution of the payment transaction.

- (10) Actions which imply access to the balance and the recent transactions of a payment account without disclosure of sensitive payment data, recurring payments to the same payees which have been previously set up or confirmed by the payer through the use of strong customer authentication, and payments to and from the same natural or legal person with accounts with the same payment service provider, pose a low level of risk, thus allowing payment service providers not to apply strong customer authentication. This leaves aside that in accordance with Articles 65, 66 and 67 Directive (EU) 2015/2366, payment initiation service providers, payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments and account information service providers should only seek and obtain the necessary and essential information from the account servicing payment service provider for the provision of a given payment service with the consent of the payment service user. Such consent can be given individually for each request of information or for each payment to be initiated or, for account information service providers, as a mandate for designated payment accounts and associated payment transactions as established in the contractual agreement with the payment service user.

- (11) Exemptions for low-value contactless payments at points of sale, which also take into account a maximum number of consecutive transactions or a certain fixed maximum value of consecutive transactions without applying strong customer authentication, allow for the development of user-friendly and low-risk payment services and should therefore be provided for. It is also appropriate to establish an exemption for the case of electronic payment transactions initiated at unattended terminals where the use of strong customer authentication may not always be easy to apply due to operational reasons (e.g. to avoid queues and potential accidents at toll gates or for other safety or security risks).

- (12) Similar to the exemption for low-value contactless payments at the point of sale, a proper balance needs to be struck between the interest in enhanced security in remote payments and the needs of user-friendliness and accessibility of payments in the area of e-commerce. In line with those principles, thresholds below which no strong customer authentication needs to be applied should be set in a prudent manner, to cover only online purchases of low value. The thresholds for online purchases should be set more prudently, considering that the fact that the person is not physically present when making the purchase is posing a slightly higher security risk.

- (13) The requirements of strong customer authentication apply to payments initiated by the payer, regardless of whether the payer is a natural person or a legal entity. Many corporate payments are initiated through dedicated processes or protocols which guarantee the high levels of payment security that Directive (EU) 2015/2366 aims to achieve through strong customer authentication. Where the competent authorities establish that those payment processes and protocols that are only made available to payers who are not consumers achieve the objectives of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 in terms of security, payment service providers may, in relation to those processes or protocols, be exempted from the strong customer authentication requirements.

- (14) In the case of real-time transaction risk analysis that categorise a payment transaction as low risk, it is also appropriate to introduce an exemption for the payment service provider that intends not to apply strong customer authentication through the adoption of effective and risk-based requirements which ensure the safety of the payment service user's funds and personal data. Those risk-based requirements should combine the scores of the risk analysis, confirming that no abnormal spending or behavioural pattern of the payer has been identified, taking into account other risk factors including information on the location of the payer and of the payee with monetary thresholds based on fraud rates calculated for remote payments. Where, on the basis of the real-time transaction risk analysis, a payment cannot be qualified as posing a low level of risk, the payment service provider should revert to strong customer authentication. The maximum value of such risk-based exemption should be set in a manner ensuring a very low corresponding fraud rate, also by comparison to the fraud rates of all the payment transactions of the payment service provider, including those authenticated through strong customer authentication, within a certain period of time and on a rolling basis.

- (15) For the purpose of ensuring an effective enforcement, payment service providers that wish to benefit from the exemptions from strong customer authentication should regularly monitor and make available to competent authorities and to the European Banking Authority (EBA), upon their request, for each payment transaction type, the value of fraudulent or unauthorised payment transactions and the observed fraud rates for all their payment transactions, whether authenticated through strong customer authentication or executed under a relevant exemption.

- (16) The collection of this new historical evidence on the fraud rates of electronic payment transactions will also contribute to an effective review by the EBA of the thresholds for an exemption to strong customer authentication based on a real-time transaction risk analysis. The EBA should review and submit draft updates to the Commission of these regulatory technical standards, where appropriate, by submitting new draft thresholds and corresponding fraud rates with the aim of enhancing the security of remote electronic payments, in accordance with Article 98(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2).

- (17) Payment service providers that make use of any of the exemptions to be provided for should be allowed at any time to choose to apply strong customer authentication to the actions and to the payment transactions referred to in those provisions.

- (18) The measures that protect the confidentiality and integrity of personalised security credentials, as well as authentication devices and software, should limit the risks relating to fraud through unauthorised or fraudulent use of payment instruments and unauthorised access to payment accounts. To this end it is necessary to introduce requirements on the secure creation and delivery of the personalised security credentials and their association with the payment service user, and to provide conditions for the renewal and deactivation of those credentials.

- (19) In order to ensure effective and secure communication between the relevant actors in the context of account information services, payment initiation services and confirmation on the availabilty of funds, it is necessary to specify the requirements of common and secure open standards of communication to be met by all relevant payment service providers. Directive (EU) 2015/2366 provides for the access and use of payment account information by account information service providers. This regulation therefore does not change the rules of access to accounts other than payment accounts.

- (20) Each account servicing payment service provider with payment accounts that are accessible online should offer at least one access interface enabling secure communication with account information service providers, payment initiation service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments. The interface should enable the account information service providers, payment initiation service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments to identify themselves to the account servicing payment service provider. It should also allow account information service providers and payment initiation service providers to rely on the authentication procedures provided by the account servicing payment service provider to the payment service user. To ensure technology and business-model neutrality, the account servicing payment service providers should be free to decide whether to offer an interface that is dedicated to the communication with account information service providers, payment initiation service providers, and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments, or to allow, for that communication, the use of the interface for the identification and communication with the account servicing payment service providers' payment service users.

- (21) In order to allow account information service providers, payment initiation service providers, and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments to develop their technical solutions, the technical specification of the interface should be adequately documented and made publicly available. Moreover, the account servicing payment service provider should offer a facility enabling the payment service providers to test the technical solutions at least 6 months prior to the application date of these regulatory standards or, if the launch takes place after the application date of these standards, prior to the date on which the interface will be launched to the market. To ensure the interoperability of different technological communication solutions, the interface should use standards of communication which are developed by international or European standardisation organisations.

- (22) The quality of the services provided by account information service providers and payment initiation service providers will be dependent on the proper functioning of the interfaces put in place or adapted by account servicing payment service providers. It is therefore important that in case of non-compliance of such interfaces with the provisions included in these standards, measures are taken to guarantee business continuity for the benefit of the users of those services. It is the responsibility of national competent authorities to ensure that account information service providers and payment intitation service providers are not blocked or obstructed in the provision of their services.

- (23) Where access to payment accounts is offered by means of a dedicated interface, in order to ensure the right of payment service users to make use of payment initiation service providers and of services enabling access to account information, as provided for in Directive (EU) 2015/2366, it is necessary to require that dedicated interfaces have the same level of availability and performance as the interface available to the payment service user. Account servicing payment service providers should also define transparent key performance indicators and service level targets for the availability and performance of dedicated interfaces that are at least as stringent as those for the interface used for their payment service users. Those interfaces should be tested by the payment service providers who will use them, and should be stress-tested and monitored by competent authorities.

- (24) To ensure that payment service providers who rely on the dedicated interface can continue to provide their services in case of problems of availability or inadequate performance, it is necessary to provide, subject to strict conditions, a fallback mechanism that will allow such providers to use the interface that the account servicing payment service provider maintains for the identification of, and communication with, its own payment service users. Certain account servicing payment service providers will be exempted from having to provide such a fallback mechanism through their customer facing interfaces where their competent authorities establish that the dedicated interfaces comply with specific conditions that ensure unhampered competition. In the event that the exempted dedicated interfaces fail to comply with the required conditions, the granted exemptions shall be revoked by the relevant competent authorities.

- (25) In order to allow competent authorities to effectively supervise and monitor the implementation and management of the communication interfaces, the account servicing payment service providers should make a summary of the relevant documentation available on their website, and provide, upon request, the competent authorities with documentation of the solutions in case of emergencies. The account servicing payment service providers should also make publicly available the statistics on the availability and performance of that interface.

- (26) In order to safeguard the confidentiality and the integrity of data, it is necessary to ensure the security of communication sessions between account servicing payment service providers, account information service providers, payment initiation service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments. It is in particular necessary to require that secure encryption is applied between account information service providers, payment initiation service providers, payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments and account servicing payment service providers when exchanging data.

- (27) To improve user confidence and ensure strong customer authentication, the use of electronic identification means and trust services as set out in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) should be taken into account, in particular with regard to notified electronic identification schemes

- (28) In order to ensure aligned application dates, this Regulation should be applicable from the same date as of which Member States have to ensure application of the security measures referred to in Articles 65, 66, 67 and 97 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366.

- (29) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to the Commission.

- (30) EBA has conducted open and transparent public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010,

## Enacting Terms

## CHAPTER I — GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article 1

**Subject matter**

This Regulation establishes the requirements to be complied with by payment service providers for the purpose of implementing security measures which enable them to do the following:

- (a) apply the procedure of strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366;
- (b) exempt the application of the security requirements of strong customer authentication, subject to specified and limited conditions based on the level of risk, the amount and the recurrence of the payment transaction and of the payment channel used for its execution;
- (c) protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service user's personalised security credentials;
- (d) establish common and secure open standards for the communication between account servicing payment service providers, payment initiation service providers, account information service providers, payers, payees and other payment service providers in relation to the provision and use of payment services in application of Title IV of Directive (EU) 2015/2366.
### Article 2

**General authentication requirements**

1. Payment service providers shall have transaction monitoring mechanisms in place that enable them to detect unauthorised or fraudulent payment transactions for the purpose of the implementation of the security measures referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 1.

Those mechanisms shall be based on the analysis of payment transactions taking into account elements which are typical of the payment service user in the circumstances of a normal use of the personalised security credentials.

2. Payment service providers shall ensure that the transaction monitoring mechanisms take into account, at a minimum, each of the following risk-based factors:

- (a) lists of compromised or stolen authentication elements;
- (b) the amount of each payment transaction;
- (c) known fraud scenarios in the provision of payment services;
- (d) signs of malware infection in any sessions of the authentication procedure;
- (e) in case the access device or the software is provided by the payment service provider, a log of the use of the access device or the software provided to the payment service user and the abnormal use of the access device or the software.
### Article 3

**Review of the security measures**

1. The implementation of the security measures referred to in Article 1 shall be documented, periodically tested, evaluated and audited in accordance with the applicable legal framework of the payment service provider by auditors with expertise in IT security and payments and operationally independent within or from the payment service provider.

2. The period between the audits referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined taking into account the relevant accounting and statutory audit framework applicable to the payment service provider.

However, payment service providers that make use of the exemption referred to in Article 18 shall be subject to an audit of the methodology, the model and the reported fraud rates at a minimum on a yearly basis. The auditor performing this audit shall have expertise in IT security and payments and be operationally independent within or from the payment service provider. During the first year of making use of the exemption under Article 18 and at least every 3 years thereafter, or more frequently at the competent authority's request, this audit shall be carried out by an independent and qualified external auditor.

3. This audit shall present an evaluation and report on the compliance of the payment service provider's security measures with the requirements set out in this Regulation.

The entire report shall be made available to competent authorities upon their request.

## CHAPTER II — SECURITY MEASURES FOR THE APPLICATION OF STRONG CUSTOMER AUTHENTICATION

### Article 4

**Authentication code**

1. Where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, the authentication shall be based on two or more elements which are categorised as knowledge, possession and inherence and shall result in the generation of an authentication code.

The authentication code shall be only accepted once by the payment service provider when the payer uses the authentication code to access its payment account online, to initiate an electronic payment transaction or to carry out any action through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses.

2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, payment service providers shall adopt security measures ensuring that each of the following requirements is met:

- (a) no information on any of the elements referred to in paragraph 1 can be derived from the disclosure of the authentication code;
- (b) it is not possible to generate a new authentication code based on the knowledge of any other authentication code previously generated;
- (c) the authentication code cannot be forged.
3. Payment service providers shall ensure that the authentication by means of generating an authentication code includes each of the following measures:

- (a) where the authentication for remote access, remote electronic payments and any other actions through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses has failed to generate an authentication code for the purposes of paragraph 1, it shall not be possible to identify which of the elements referred to in that paragraph was incorrect;
- (b) the number of failed authentication attempts that can take place consecutively, after which the actions referred to in Article 97(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 shall be temporarily or permanently blocked, shall not exceed five within a given period of time;
- (c) the communication sessions are protected against the capture of authentication data transmitted during the authentication and against manipulation by unauthorised parties in accordance with the requirements in Chapter V;
- (d) the maximum time without activity by the payer after being authenticated for accessing its payment account online shall not exceed 5 minutes.
4. Where the block referred to in paragraph 3(b) is temporary, the duration of that block and the number of retries shall be established based on the characteristics of the service provided to the payer and all the relevant risks involved, taking into account, at a minimum, the factors referred to in Article 2(2).

The payer shall be alerted before the block is made permanent.

Where the block has been made permanent, a secure procedure shall be established allowing the payer to regain use of the blocked electronic payment instruments.

### Article 5

**Dynamic linking**

1. Where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, in addition to the requirements of Article 4 of this Regulation, they shall also adopt security measures that meet each of the following requirements:

- (a) the payer is made aware of the amount of the payment transaction and of the payee;
- (b) the authentication code generated is specific to the amount of the payment transaction and the payee agreed to by the payer when initiating the transaction;
- (c) the authentication code accepted by the payment service provider corresponds to the original specific amount of the payment transaction and to the identity of the payee agreed to by the payer;
- (d) any change to the amount or the payee results in the invalidation of the authentication code generated.
2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, payment service providers shall adopt security measures which ensure the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of each of the following:

- (a) the amount of the transaction and the payee throughout all of the phases of the authentication;
- (b) the information displayed to the payer throughout all of the phases of the authentication including the generation, transmission and use of the authentication code.
3. For the purpose of paragraph 1(b) and where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 the following requirements for the authentication code shall apply:

- (a) in relation to a card-based payment transaction for which the payer has given consent to the exact amount of the funds to be blocked pursuant to Article 75(1) of that Directive, the authentication code shall be specific to the amount that the payer has given consent to be blocked and agreed to by the payer when initiating the transaction;
- (b) in relation to payment transactions for which the payer has given consent to execute a batch of remote electronic payment transactions to one or several payees, the authentication code shall be specific to the total amount of the batch of payment transactions and to the specified payees.
### Article 6

**Requirements of the elements categorised as knowledge**

1. Payment service providers shall adopt measures to mitigate the risk that the elements of strong customer authentication categorised as knowledge are uncovered by, or disclosed to, unauthorised parties.

2. The use by the payer of those elements shall be subject to mitigation measures in order to prevent their disclosure to unauthorised parties.

### Article 7

**Requirements of the elements categorised as possession**

1. Payment service providers shall adopt measures to mitigate the risk that the elements of strong customer authentication categorised as possession are used by unauthorised parties.

2. The use by the payer of those elements shall be subject to measures designed to prevent replication of the elements.

### Article 8

**Requirements of devices and software linked to elements categorised as inherence**

1. Payment service providers shall adopt measures to mitigate the risk that the authentication elements categorised as inherence and read by access devices and software provided to the payer are uncovered by unauthorised parties. At a minimum, the payment service providers shall ensure that those access devices and software have a very low probability of an unauthorised party being authenticated as the payer.

2. The use by the payer of those elements shall be subject to measures ensuring that those devices and the software guarantee resistance against unauthorised use of the elements through access to the devices and the software.

### Article 9

**Independence of the elements**

1. Payment service providers shall ensure that the use of the elements of strong customer authentication referred to in Articles 6, 7 and 8 is subject to measures which ensure that, in terms of technology, algorithms and parameters, the breach of one of the elements does not compromise the reliability of the other elements.

2. Payment service providers shall adopt security measures, where any of the elements of strong customer authentication or the authentication code itself is used through a multi-purpose device, to mitigate the risk which would result from that multi-purpose device being compromised.

3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the mitigating measures shall include each of the following:

- (a) the use of separated secure execution environments through the software installed inside the multi-purpose device;
- (b) mechanisms to ensure that the software or device has not been altered by the payer or by a third party;
- (c) where alterations have taken place, mechanisms to mitigate the consequences thereof.
## CHAPTER III — EXEMPTIONS FROM STRONG CUSTOMER AUTHENTICATION

- (a) the individual amount of the contactless electronic payment transaction does not exceed EUR 50; and
- (b) the cumulative amount of previous contactless electronic payment transactions initiated by means of a payment instrument with a contactless functionality from the date of the last application of strong customer authentication does not exceed EUR 150; or
- (c) the number of consecutive contactless electronic payment transactions initiated via the payment instrument offering a contactless functionality since the last application of strong customer authentication does not exceed five.
### Article 12

**Unattended terminals for transport fares and parking fees**

Payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication, subject to compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 2, where the payer initiates an electronic payment transaction at an unattended payment terminal for the purpose of paying a transport fare or a parking fee.

### Article 13

**Trusted beneficiaries**

1. Payment service providers shall apply strong customer authentication where a payer creates or amends a list of trusted beneficiaries through the payer's account servicing payment service provider.

2. Payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication, subject to compliance with the general authentication requirements, where the payer initiates a payment transaction and the payee is included in a list of trusted beneficiaries previously created by the payer.

### Article 14

**Recurring transactions**

1. Payment service providers shall apply strong customer authentication when a payer creates, amends, or initiates for the first time, a series of recurring transactions with the same amount and with the same payee.

2. Payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication, subject to compliance with the general authentication requirements, for the initiation of all subsequent payment transactions included in the series of payment transactions referred to in paragraph 1.

### Article 15

**Credit transfers between accounts held by the same natural or legal person**

Payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication, subject to compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 2, where the payer initiates a credit transfer in circumstances where the payer and the payee are the same natural or legal person and both payment accounts are held by the same account servicing payment service provider.

### Article 16

**Low-value transactions**

### Article 18

**Transaction risk analysis**

1. Payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication where the payer initiates a remote electronic payment transaction identified by the payment service provider as posing a low level of risk according to the transaction monitoring mechanisms referred to in Article 2 and in paragraph 2(c) of this Article.

2. An electronic payment transaction referred to in paragraph 1 shall be considered as posing a low level of risk where all the following conditions are met:

- (a) the fraud rate for that type of transaction, reported by the payment service provider and calculated in accordance with Article 19, is equivalent to or below the reference fraud rates specified in the table set out in the Annex for ‘remote electronic card-based payments’ and ‘remote electronic credit transfers’ respectively;
- (b) the amount of the transaction does not exceed the relevant exemption threshold value (‘ETV’) specified in the table set out in the Annex;
- (c) payment service providers as a result of performing a real time risk analysis have not identified any of the following:
- (i) abnormal spending or behavioural pattern of the payer;
(ii)

unusual information about the payer's device/software access;

(iii)

malware infection in any session of the authentication procedure;

(iv)

known fraud scenario in the provision of payment services;

- (v) abnormal location of the payer;
(vi)

high-risk location of the payee.

3. Payment service providers that intend to exempt electronic remote payment transactions from strong customer authentication on the ground that they pose a low risk shall take into account at a minimum, the following risk-based factors:

- (a) the previous spending patterns of the individual payment service user;
- (b) the payment transaction history of each of the payment service provider's payment service users;
- (c) the location of the payer and of the payee at the time of the payment transaction in cases where the access device or the software is provided by the payment service provider;
- (d) the identification of abnormal payment patterns of the payment service user in relation to the user's payment transaction history.
The assessment made by a payment service provider shall combine all those risk-based factors into a risk scoring for each individual transaction to determine whether a specific payment should be allowed without strong customer authentication.

### Article 19

**Calculation of fraud rates**

1. For each type of transaction referred to in the table set out in the Annex, the payment service provider shall ensure that the overall fraud rates covering both payment transactions authenticated through strong customer authentication and those executed under any of the exemptions referred to in Articles 13 to 18 are equivalent to, or lower than, the reference fraud rate for the same type of payment transaction indicated in the table set out in the Annex.

The overall fraud rate for each type of transaction shall be calculated as the total value of unauthorised or fraudulent remote transactions, whether the funds have been recovered or not, divided by the total value of all remote transactions for the same type of transactions, whether authenticated with the application of strong customer authentication or executed under any exemption referred to in Articles 13 to 18 on a rolling quarterly basis (90 days).

2. The calculation of the fraud rates and resulting figures shall be assessed by the audit review referred to in Article 3(2), which shall ensure that they are complete and accurate.

3.

Account servicing payment service providers shall establish the interface(s) referred to in Article 30 by means of a dedicated interface or by allowing the use by the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) of the interfaces used for authentication and communication with the account servicing payment service provider's payment services users.

### Article 32

**Obligations for a dedicated interface**

1. Subject to compliance with Article 30 and 31, account servicing payment service providers that have put in place a dedicated interface shall ensure that the dedicated interface offers at all times the same level of availability and performance, including support, as the interfaces made available to the payment service user for directly accessing its payment account online.

2. Account servicing payment service providers that have put in place a dedicated interface shall define transparent key performance indicators and service level targets, at least as stringent as those set for the interface used by their payment service users both in terms of availability and of data provided in accordance with Article 36. Those interfaces, indicators and targets shall be monitored by the competent authorities and stress-tested.

3. Account servicing payment service providers that have put in place a dedicated interface shall ensure that this interface does not create obstacles to the provision of payment initiation and account information services. Such obstacles, may include, among others, preventing the use by payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) of the credentials issued by account servicing payment service providers to their customers, imposing redirection to the account servicing payment service provider's authentication or other functions, requiring additional authorisations and registrations in addition to those provided for in Articles 11, 14 and 15 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, or requiring additional checks of the consent given by payment service users to providers of payment initiation and account information services.

4. For the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2, account servicing payment service providers shall monitor the availability and performance of the dedicated interface. Account servicing payment service providers shall publish on their website quarterly statistics on the availability and performance of the dedicated interface and of the interface used by its payment service users.

### Article 33

**Contingency measures for a dedicated interface**

1. Account servicing payment service providers shall include, in the design of the dedicated interface, a strategy and plans for contingency measures for the event that the interface does not perform in compliance with Article 32, that there is unplanned unavailability of the interface and that there is a systems breakdown. Unplanned unavailability or a systems breakdown may be presumed to have arisen when five consecutive requests for access to information for the provision of payment initiation services or account information services are not replied to within 30 seconds.

2. Contingency measures shall include communication plans to inform payment service providers making use of the dedicated interface of measures to restore the system and a description of the immediately available alternative options payment service providers may have during this time.

3. Both the account servicing payment service provider and the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) shall report problems with dedicated interfaces as described in paragraph 1 to their respective competent national authorities without delay.

4. As part of a contingency mechanism, payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) shall be allowed to make use of the interfaces made available to the payment service users for the authentication and communication with their account servicing payment service provider, until the dedicated interface is restored to the level of availability and performance provided for in Article 32.

5. For this purpose, account servicing payment service providers shall ensure that the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) can be identified and can rely on the authentication procedures provided by the account servicing payment service provider to the payment service user. Where the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) make use of the interface referred to in paragraph 4 they shall:

- (a) take the necessary measures to ensure that they do not access, store or process data for purposes other than for the provision of the service as requested by the payment service user;
- (b) continue to comply with the obligations following from Article 66(3) and Article 67(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 respectively;
