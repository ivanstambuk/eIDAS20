## Scope: Two SCA Use Cases

This assessment covers **two distinct use cases** in the SCA attestation lifecycle:

| Use Case | Phase | Protocol | RTS Chapter | Wallet Role |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Issuance/Binding** | PSP issues SCA attestation to wallet | OID4VCI | Chapter IV (Art. 22-27) | Key generation, secure storage, user auth for binding |
| **Usage/Authentication** | User authenticates during payment | OID4VP | Chapter II (Art. 4-9) | SCA execution, factor validation, auth code generation |

### Use Case 1: Issuance/Binding

The PSP (as **Issuer**) creates an SCA attestation and binds it to the user:

1. User requests SCA attestation from PSP (e.g., during onboarding)
2. Wallet generates key pair in WSCA/WSCD (Secure Enclave / StrongBox)
3. User authenticates to prove identity (SCA required for remote binding per Art. 24(2)(b))
4. PSP issues attestation bound to wallet's public key
5. Wallet stores attestation securely in WSCD

**Relevant RTS Articles**: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27  
**Covered in**: [Part III: SCA Attestation Lifecycle](#part-iii-sca-attestation-lifecycle-issuancebinding)

### Use Case 2: Usage/Authentication

The PSP (as **Relying Party/Verifier**) requests SCA during a payment:

1. PSP sends OID4VP authorization request with transaction data
2. Wallet displays transaction details to user (amount, payee)
3. User authenticates (PIN/biometric) via WSCA/WSCD
4. Wallet generates KB-JWT with `transaction_data_hashes` (dynamic linking)
5. Wallet returns VP Token (the "authentication code")
6. PSP verifies signature and processes payment

**Relevant RTS Articles**: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
**Covered in**: [Part II: SCA Authentication (Usage)](#part-ii-sca-authentication-usage)

## Executive Summary

EUDI Wallet, when implementing TS12 and ARF requirements, provides **substantial coverage** of PSD2 RTS requirements for SCA. Key findings:

| Category | Count | Summary |
|----------|-------|---------|
| ✅ Wallet Compliant | 25 | Core SCA mechanics + credential lifecycle |
| ⚠️ Shared Responsibility | 9 | Wallet provides evidence; PSP must verify |
| ❌ **Gap Identified** | **1** | **PIN lockout NOT implemented** (Art. 4(3)(b)) |
| ❌ PSP Only | 11 | Risk analysis, audit, key management docs |
| 🔶 Rulebook Pending | 4 | Deferred to SCA Attestation Rulebook |

| ➖ Not Applicable | 6 | Exemptions, contactless, reusable devices |

**Critical ARF HLRs for SCA**:
- **SUA_01–SUA_06** (Topic 20): Strong User Authentication for electronic payments
- **WIAM_14–WIAM_17** (Topic 40): WSCA/WSCD user authentication
- **WUA_09–WUA_12** (Topic 9): Wallet Unit Attestation key binding
- **RPA_01–RPA_08** (Topic 6): Relying Party authentication and user approval

> ⚠️ **Critical Dependency**: The **SCA Attestation Rulebook** does not yet exist as a published document (as of Jan 2026). TS12 defines the protocol ("pipes"), but delegates the data schemas (what fields to display, IBAN vs card number, etc.) to future rulebooks to be authored by industry bodies (EPC for SEPA, EMVCo/schemes for cards). Items marked 🔶 in this assessment await rulebook publication. See [Appendix E](#appendix-e-sca-attestation-rulebook-status) for details.

**Use Case Coverage**:

| Use Case | RTS Articles | Document Part |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Issuance/Binding** | 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 | Part III |
| **Usage/Authentication** | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | Part II |

## Terminology

### Key Terms from PSD2 RTS

| Term | Definition | Source |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** | Authentication based on two or more elements from knowledge, possession, and inherence categories | RTS Art. 4(1) |
| **Personalised Security Credentials (PSC)** | Personalised features provided by PSP for authentication purposes | PSD2 Art. 4(31) |
| **Authentication Code** | Digital signatures or other cryptographically underpinned validity assertions generated from authentication elements | RTS Recital (4) |
| **Dynamic Linking** | SCA that includes elements dynamically linking the transaction to a specific amount and payee | RTS Art. 5 |

### EUDI Wallet Terminology

| Term | Definition | Source |
|------|------------|--------|
| **WSCA** | Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application | ARF Glossary |
| **WSCD** | Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (hardware security module) | ARF Glossary |
| **WUA** | Wallet Unit Attestation | ARF Topic 9 |
| **PID** | Person Identification Data | ARF Glossary |
| **SUA** | Strong User Authentication (attestation type for payments) | ARF Topic 20 |
| **KB-JWT** | Key Binding JWT (signature proving possession) | SD-JWT-VC Spec |

### Authentication Factor Mapping

| RTS Category | EUDI Wallet Implementation |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Knowledge** | User PIN or passphrase validated by WSCA/WSCD |
| **Possession** | Private key stored in WSCA/WSCD (Secure Enclave / StrongBox) |
| **Inherence** | Biometric validated by OS (Face ID / BiometricPrompt) |

### PSD2 → EUDI Wallet Terminology Cross-Reference

This table maps PSD2/RTS terminology to their EUDI Wallet equivalents:

| PSD2/RTS Term | EUDI Wallet Equivalent | Explanation |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Personalised Security Credentials (PSC)** | All SCA Elements | Per PSD2 Art. 4(31), PSCs are "personalised features provided by the PSP for authentication." In EUDIW, this encompasses **all three SCA element types**: (1) **PIN/Passphrase** (knowledge), (2) **Biometric template** (inherence), and (3) **SCA Attestation + Private Key** (possession). The PIN/biometric unlocks access to the private key, and together they enable generation of the authentication code. |
| **Authentication Code** | VP Token (KB-JWT signature) | RTS Recital 4 defines this as "digital signatures or other cryptographically underpinned validity assertions." In EUDIW, this is the signed VP Token containing the KB-JWT with `transaction_data_hashes` |
| **Authentication Device** | Wallet Unit (WSCA/WSCD) | The user's device running the Wallet Instance with its associated Wallet Unit Attestation and secure hardware |
| **PIN** | User PIN / Passphrase | **PSC (Knowledge element)** — validated locally by WSCA/WSCD (never transmitted). Protected per RTS Art. 6 & Art. 22. |
| **Biometric** | OS Biometric (Face ID / BiometricPrompt) | **PSC (Inherence element)** — validated by OS secure biometric API with liveness detection. Protected per RTS Art. 8 & Art. 22. |
| **Dynamic Linking** | `transaction_data_hashes` in KB-JWT | The cryptographic binding of amount + payee to the authentication code via hashing and signing |
| **One-time use** | `jti` + `nonce` claims | Each VP Token has unique `jti` (JWT ID) and must respond to a fresh `nonce` from the verifier |
| **Secure Channel** | TLS 1.2+ (OID4VP) | Mutually authenticated encrypted channel between wallet and PSP |
| **Authentication elements** | SCA Factors | Knowledge (PIN), Possession (private key), Inherence (biometric) |
| **Payment Service Provider (PSP)** | Relying Party (Verifier) + Attestation Provider (Issuer) | PSP has dual role: issues SCA attestation (OID4VCI) and verifies authentication (OID4VP) |
| **Payer** | User / Wallet Holder | The natural person using the EUDI Wallet |

### Key Insight: Authentication Code = VP Token

The most important mapping is understanding that the **authentication code** (RTS Art. 4) is the **VP Token**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AUTHENTICATION CODE (RTS Art. 4)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   VP Token                                                      │
│   ├── SD-JWT-VC (the SCA attestation)                          │
│   └── KB-JWT (Key Binding JWT)                                  │
│       ├── aud: PSP's client_id                                  │
│       ├── nonce: from PSP's request (one-time use)              │
│       ├── iat: timestamp                                        │
│       ├── jti: unique token ID (additional one-time protection)│
│       ├── amr: ["pin", "hwk"] (factor evidence)                │
│       └── transaction_data_hashes: SHA-256 of amount+payee     │

# Part I: PSD2 Directive (2015/2366)

## [Article 97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366#art_97) — Authentication

> *PSD2 Directive Article 97 establishes the legal basis for SCA. The technical details are in RTS 2018/389.*

### [Article 97(1)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366#097.001) — SCA Triggers

> "Member States shall ensure that a payment service provider applies strong customer authentication where the payer:
> (a) accesses its payment account online;
> (b) initiates an electronic payment transaction;
> (c) carries out any action through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses."

| ⚠️ **Shared** | — | PSP determines when to trigger SCA (all three scenarios) |

**Status**: ✅ Supported

**Context**: TS12 defines four standardised transaction types corresponding to the three PSD2 triggers:

| PSD2 Trigger | TS12 URN | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| [Art. 97(1)(a)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366#097.001) | `urn:eudi:sca:login_risk_transaction:1` | Access payment account online |

| [Art. 97(1)(b)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366#097.001) | `urn:eudi:sca:payment:1` | Initiate electronic payment |
| [Art. 97(1)(c)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366#097.001) | `urn:eudi:sca:login_risk_transaction:1` | High-risk actions (e.g., change limits) |
| (extension) | `urn:eudi:sca:emandate:1` | E-mandate setup |

> ⚠️ **Gap Identified**: The [ETPPA](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15045566) (European Third Party Provider Association) has requested a dedicated **`urn:eudi:sca:consents:1`** transaction type for AISP consent capture. This is **not yet in TS12 v1.0**. TPPs seeking to perform Embedded SCA for account information consent should monitor future TS12 versions.

**Status**: ✅ Fully Supported

**Context**: The OID4VP `transaction_data` parameter allows the PSP to pass payment details (amount, payee, IBAN). These are hashed and included in the KB-JWT's `transaction_data_hashes` array. The user sees the transaction on-screen before approving with biometric/PIN. The signature over this hash constitutes the dynamic link.

**Technical Detail** ([TS12 §3.6](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/55c5b744a2a620f44b9ca19b494ba3cbe2acf301/docs/technical-specifications/ts12-electronic-payments-SCA-implementation-with-wallet.md#36-presentation-response)):
```
KB-JWT contains:
  "transaction_data_hashes": ["sha-256 hash of transaction details"],
  "transaction_data_hashes_alg": "sha-256"
```

> ⚠️ **Format Note**: Dynamic linking via `transaction_data_hashes` is **OID4VP / SD-JWT-VC only**. TS12 v1.0 does not specify mDOC (ISO 18013-5) transaction binding. See RTS Art. 5(1)(b) for details.

### [Article 2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#art_2) — General authentication requirements

#### [Article 2(1)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#002.001)

> "Payment service providers shall have transaction monitoring mechanisms in place that enable them to detect unauthorised or fraudulent payment transactions for the purpose of the implementation of the security measures referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 1. Those mechanisms shall be based on the analysis of payment transactions taking into account elements which are typical of the payment service user in the circumstances of a normal use of the personalised security credentials."

| Fulfillment | Reference | Implementation |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| ❌ **PSP** | — | PSP must implement fraud detection systems |
| ⚠️ **Wallet Evidence** | [DASH_02–DASH_05](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a2312-topic-19---user-navigation-requirements-dashboard-logs-for-transparency) | Wallet logs all transactions for user dashboard |

**Status**: ❌ PSP Obligation

**Context**: Transaction monitoring is a PSP-side function. The Wallet provides transaction logs (per DASH_02) that could be used as supplementary evidence in dispute resolution, but the real-time fraud detection must be implemented by the PSP.

**PSP Action Required**:
- ✗ Implement transaction monitoring system
- ✗ Define risk rules and anomaly detection
- ✗ Integrate wallet responses into monitoring pipeline

| ❌ **PSP** | — | Behavioural analysis, device fingerprinting, etc. |
| ⚠️ **Wallet Evidence** | WUA attributes | WUA contains device/WSCD properties that PSP can use for fingerprinting |

**Status**: ❌ PSP Obligation

**Context**: Typical elements include: spending patterns, device fingerprint, geographic location. The Wallet Unit Attestation (WUA) contains device properties that can contribute to this analysis, but the PSP must build the monitoring logic.

**Status**: ❌ PSP Obligation (with Wallet Evidence)

**Context**: PSPs must audit their own SCA implementations. However, they can rely on Wallet Solution certification (per CIR 2024/2981) as evidence that the wallet component meets security requirements. The PSP's audit scope includes:
- Integration with wallet
- PSP-side transaction monitoring
- Exemption handling
- Session management

---

#### [Article 3(2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#003.002)

> "The period between the audits referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined taking into account the relevant accounting and statutory audit framework applicable to the payment service provider. However, payment service providers that make use of the exemption referred to in Article 18 shall be subject to an audit of the methodology, the model and the reported fraud rates at a minimum on a yearly basis. The auditor performing this audit shall have expertise in IT security and payments and be operationally independent within or from the payment service provider. During the first year of making use of the exemption under Article 18 and at least every 3 years thereafter, or more frequently at the competent authority's request, this audit shall be carried out by an independent and qualified external auditor."

**Status**: ❌ PSP Obligation — audit scheduling per applicable framework.

---

#### [Article 3(3)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#003.003)

> "This audit shall present an evaluation and report on the compliance of the payment service provider's security measures with the requirements set out in this Regulation. The entire report shall be made available to competent authorities upon their request."

**Status**: ❌ PSP Obligation — only if using TRA exemption.

**Status**: ✅ Fully Supported

**Context**: 

**Authentication Elements**:
- **Knowledge**: User PIN or passphrase (validated by WSCA/WSCD before crypto operation)
- **Possession**: Private key stored in WSCA/WSCD (Secure Enclave / StrongBox)
- **Inherence**: Biometric (Face ID / fingerprint), delegated to OS biometric API

**Authentication Code**:
Per RTS Recital (4), authentication codes should be based on "digital signatures or other cryptographically underpinned validity assertions". The **complete VP Token** (SD-JWT with KB-JWT signature) or **mDOC DeviceResponse** constitutes the authentication code. The KB-JWT signature is generated using the SCA attestation private key in the WSCA/WSCD.

**Factor Reporting** (TS12 §3.6):
```json
"amr": ["face", "hwk"]  // Face ID + hardware key = inherence + possession
"amr": ["pin", "hwk"]   // PIN + hardware key = knowledge + possession
```

> 📌 **Community Validation**: The `amr` claim was [proposed by community member senexi](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15133961) (Dec 2025) to align with OIDC standards — and was **adopted in TS12 v1.0**.

> ⚠️ **Format Note**: The `amr` claim is **SD-JWT-VC only** (via KB-JWT). TS12 v1.0 does not specify an equivalent mechanism for **mDOC (ISO 18013-5)**. PSPs requiring mDOC support should monitor TS12 updates.

| ⚠️ **PSP** | — | PSP must track accepted codes and reject replays |

**Status**: ⚠️ Shared Responsibility

**Context**: The Wallet generates a cryptographically unique response for each presentation:
- `nonce`: Echoed from PSP's request (binds to session)
- `jti`: Unique JWT ID per response
- `iat`: Issuance timestamp

**Authentication Code Interpretation**:

TS12 §3.6 states the `jti` "serves as the Authentication Code". However, RTS Recital (4) defines authentication codes as "digital signatures or other cryptographically underpinned validity assertions":

| Interpretation | What Constitutes Auth Code | Recommended Use |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Narrow (TS12)** | `jti` claim alone | Replay prevention tracking |
| **Broad (RTS-aligned)** | Complete VP Token (SD-JWT + KB-JWT signature) | Regulatory compliance evidence |

**Conclusion**: For compliance purposes, the **complete signed VP Token** satisfies the RTS "digital signature" definition. The `jti` provides the unique tracking ID within that signature.

**PSP MUST**:
1. Verify `nonce` matches the original request
2. Track accepted `jti` values (or response hashes) to prevent replay
3. Validate `iat` is within acceptable time window

**Reference Implementation**:

> ⚠️ **Format Note**: The `jti`, `nonce`, and `iat` claims are in the **KB-JWT (SD-JWT-VC only)**. For **mDOC**, the DeviceResponse signature provides cryptographic uniqueness, but TS12 v1.0 does not specify mDOC-specific claim equivalents.

**Status**: ✅ Fully Supported

**Context**: The VP Token reveals:
- Factor names in `amr` (e.g., "pin", "face", "hwk") — **not** the PIN value or biometric template
- Public key in the SCA attestation — **not** the private key
- Signature over transaction data — **not** the key material

The WSCA/WSCD (Secure Enclave / TEE) ensures private keys are non-extractable (WIAM_20).

**Status**: ❌ **Compliance Gap** (Both Platforms)

**Context**: 
- **Biometric (compliant)**: OS APIs (`LAContext`, `BiometricPrompt`) return generic failure — cannot distinguish "wrong finger" from "sensor error"
- **PIN (GAP)**: Both reference implementations reveal PIN-specific error messages
- **PSP side**: If signature verification fails, PSP should return generic error — not specify which check failed

**Reference Implementation Evidence**:

| Platform | Source File | User-Visible Message | Compliance |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| **iOS** | [`Localizable.xcstrings`](reference-impl/eudi-app-ios-wallet-ui/Modules/logic-resources/Sources/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings) | **"Pins do not match"** | ❌ Gap |
| **Android** | [`strings.xml`](reference-impl/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui/resources-logic/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) | **"Pins do not match"** | ❌ Gap |

**Localization Keys**:
- iOS: `quick_pin_dont_match` → `"Pins do not match"`
- Android: `quick_pin_non_match` → `"Pins do not match"`

**iOS Code Evidence** (commit `055bdda8`):
```swift
// When PINs don't match during confirmation:
guard previousPin == uiPinInputField else {
  setState {
    $0.copy(pinError: .quickPinDoNotMatch)  // → "Pins do not match"
  }
  return
}
```

> ❌ **Finding**: Both iOS and Android reference implementations display **"Pins do not match"** — this explicitly reveals that the **PIN** (knowledge element) was incorrect, violating Article 4(3)(a).

---

**Remediation Guidance**

For PSD2-compliant wallet deployments, implementations MUST NOT reveal which authentication element failed. The following changes are required:

| Platform | Current (Non-Compliant) | Required (Compliant) |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **iOS** | `"Pins do not match"` | `"Authentication failed"` |
| **Android** | `"Pins do not match"` | `"Authentication failed"` |
| **Biometric** | (OS handles — already compliant) | — |

**Compliant Error Messages** (examples):
- ✅ `"Authentication failed"`
- ✅ `"Unable to verify your identity"`
- ✅ `"Please try again"`
- ❌ ~~`"Incorrect PIN"`~~
- ❌ ~~`"Pins do not match"`~~
- ❌ ~~`"Biometric not recognized"`~~ (if wallet-level)

**Code Changes Required**:

| Platform | File | Key | Change |
|----------|------|-----|--------|
| iOS | `Localizable.xcstrings` | `quick_pin_dont_match` | Replace with generic message |
| Android | `strings.xml` | `quick_pin_non_match` | Replace with generic message |

**Rationale**: Article 4(3)(a) exists to prevent attackers from learning which authentication factor they need to compromise. If a system reveals "PIN incorrect", an attacker who has already cloned the device (possession) now knows they only need to brute-force the PIN. Generic messages provide no such guidance.

> ℹ️ **Note**: There is no explicit ARF HLR requiring generic failure messages. OS biometric APIs are compliant by design, but wallet-level PIN validation must also implement this pattern. This gap should be addressed in wallet implementations intended for PSD2-regulated payment use cases.

#### [Article 4(3)(b)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#004.003) — Maximum attempts and lockout

> "(b) the number of failed authentication attempts that can take place consecutively, after which the actions referred to in Article 97(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 shall be temporarily or permanently blocked, shall not exceed five within a given period of time;"

| Fulfillment | Reference | Implementation |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| ✅ **Wallet/OS** | iOS/Android | OS biometric lockout after 5 failed attempts |
| ❌ **Wallet** | — | **PIN lockout NOT implemented** (see evidence below) |
| 🔶 **Rulebook** | — | SCA Attestation Rulebook may specify constraints |
| ❌ **PSP** | — | PSP must implement server-side lockout |

**Status**: ❌ **Gap Identified** — PIN lockout not implemented in reference implementation

**Context**: Art. 4(3)(b) applies to **all PSC types** (PIN, biometric, private key). Current status:

| PSC Type | Max Attempts | Lockout Behavior | Compliance |
|----------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| **Biometric** | 5 | OS-enforced (falls back to device PIN) | ✅ Compliant |
| **Wallet PIN** | **Unlimited** | **None** | ❌ **Non-compliant** |
| **Device PIN** | Varies by OEM (typically 5-10) | Device wipe after max | ✅ Compliant |

**Reference Implementation Evidence**:

**Android** — `QuickPinInteractor.kt` (lines 92-109):
```kotlin
override fun isCurrentPinValid(pin: String): Flow<QuickPinInteractorPinValidPartialState> =
    flow {
        if (pinStorageController.isPinValid(pin)) {
            emit(QuickPinInteractorPinValidPartialState.Success)
        } else {
            emit(
                QuickPinInteractorPinValidPartialState.Failed(
                    resourceProvider.getString(R.string.quick_pin_invalid_error)
                )
            )
        }
    }
// ⚠️ NO attempt counting, NO lockout state, NO time-based blocking
```

**iOS** — `QuickPinInteractor.swift` (lines 42-47):
```swift
public func isPinValid(pin: String) -> QuickPinPartialState {
    if self.isCurrentPinValid(pin: pin) {
        return .success
    } else {
        return .failure(AuthenticationError.quickPinInvalid)
    }
}
// ⚠️ NO attempt counting, NO lockout mechanism
```

**ARF HLR Gap**: No explicit ARF HLR mandates PIN lockout. However:
- **WIAM_17** references CIR 2015/1502 section 2.2.1 for LoA High compliance
- **CIR 2015/1502 §2.3.1** requires protection against "guessing" attacks with "high attack potential"
- **ARF Annex 5.02** Design Guide mentions "e.g., 3 failed attempts" as example lockout behavior

**Remediation Required**:

```kotlin
// Required implementation pattern:
class PinLockoutController {
    companion object {
        const val MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 5
        const val LOCKOUT_DURATION_MS = 120_000L  // 2 minutes
    }
    
    private var failedAttempts = 0
    private var lockoutUntil: Long = 0
    
    fun validatePin(pin: String): PinValidationResult {
        if (System.currentTimeMillis() < lockoutUntil) {
            return PinValidationResult.Locked(
                remainingMs = lockoutUntil - System.currentTimeMillis()
            )
        }
        
        if (!pinStorageController.isPinValid(pin)) {
            failedAttempts++
            if (failedAttempts >= MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS) {
                lockoutUntil = System.currentTimeMillis() + LOCKOUT_DURATION_MS
                failedAttempts = 0
                return PinValidationResult.Locked(remainingMs = LOCKOUT_DURATION_MS)
            }
            return PinValidationResult.Failed(attemptsRemaining = MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS - failedAttempts)
        }
        
        failedAttempts = 0
        return PinValidationResult.Success
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Critical**: This gap affects **both** SCA (payment authentication) **and** PID (identification) use cases. The wallet PIN is a PSC under PSD2 Art. 4(31) and must be protected against brute-force attacks per Art. 4(3)(b) and CIR 2015/1502.

**Status**: ✅ Fully Supported

**Context**: The Wallet displays:
- Payee name and ID (from `payee` object)
- Amount and currency (from `amount`, `currency` fields)
- Any PISP information if third-party initiated (from `pisp` object)

The user must approve (biometric/PIN) after viewing this information.

**TPP Scenario Coverage**:

TS12 §2.1 defines two SCA flow types:
1. **Issuer-Requested Flow**: RP = User's PSP (bank initiates SCA for login)
2. **Third-Party-Requested Flow**: RP = TPP (PISP/AISP initiates SCA)

The TS12 JSON schemas include explicit TPP objects:

**PISP Object** (payment initiation):
```json
{
  "pisp": {
    "name": "PaymentApp",
    "id": "PISP-ID-123",
    "bic": "PISPDEFF"
  }
}
```

**AISP Object** (account access):
```json
{
  "aisp": {
    "name": "AccountAggregator",
    "id": "AISP-ID-456"
  }
}
```

**UI Implication**: When a TPP initiates SCA, the Wallet displays **both**:
- The TPP name (e.g., "PaymentApp")
- The underlying PSP name (from attestation issuer)

This dual display ensures user awareness of who is requesting access.

> "(c) the authentication code accepted by the payment service provider corresponds to the original specific amount of the payment transaction and to the identity of the payee agreed to by the payer;"

**Core Requirement**: Unlike Art. 5(1)(a-b) which are wallet-enforced, this requirement places **verification responsibility on the PSP**. The PSP must actively validate that the authentication code (KB-JWT) matches the original transaction request before executing the payment.

| Verification Step | Responsibility | Reference | Status |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **KB-JWT Signature** | PSP | [OID4VP §6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) | ✅ Cryptographic |
| **SCA Attestation Validity** | PSP | TS12 §3.1 | ✅ Certificate chain |
| **`transaction_data_hashes` Match** | PSP | TS12 §3.6 | ⚠️ PSP Implementation |
| **`nonce` Freshness** | PSP | OID4VP | ⚠️ PSP Implementation |
| **`aud` Binding** | PSP | OID4VP | ⚠️ PSP Implementation |
| **`iat` Timestamp Validity** | PSP | TS12 §3.6 | ⚠️ Optional |

**Status**: ⚠️ **PSP Verification Required** — Wallet generates compliant code; PSP must verify

**Issuer-Requested vs. Third-Party-Requested Flow**

The verification complexity differs significantly between the two TS12-defined flows:

| Aspect | Issuer-Requested Flow | Third-Party-Requested Flow |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Verifier** | PSP = Attestation Issuer | PSP ≠ RP (TPP is RP) |
| **Trust Model** | PSP trusts its own attestation | PSP must trust TPP + Wallet |
| **Transaction Origin** | PSP generated `transaction_data` | TPP generated `transaction_data` |
| **Hash Verification** | PSP compares against own data | PSP must receive TPP's original data |
| **Liability** | PSP fully responsible | PISP bears proof burden ([PSD2 Art. 73](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366#d1e5274-35-1)) |

**Issuer-Requested Flow** (simpler):
```
┌──────────┐      ┌────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│   User   │ ──── │   Wallet   │ ──── │     PSP      │
│          │      │            │      │  (RP=Issuer) │
└──────────┘      └────────────┘      └──────────────┘
                        │                    │
                     VP Token ────────────▶  │
                                    PSP verifies against
                                    its OWN original request
```

**Third-Party-Requested Flow** (complex):
```
┌──────────┐      ┌────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│   User   │ ──── │   Wallet   │ ──── │  TPP (PISP)  │ ──── │   PSP    │
│          │      │            │      │     (RP)     │      │  (Bank)  │
└──────────┘      └────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └──────────┘
                        │                    │                    │
                     VP Token ────────────▶  │                    │
                                             │                    │
                                      VP Token + ─────────────▶   │
                                      transaction_data            │
                                                         PSP verifies but
                                                         cannot verify TPP's
                                                         retrieval method
```

**Gap Analysis: TPP Flow Verification**

> ⚠️ **Critical Open Issue**: In the Third-Party-Requested flow, the PSP receives the VP Token from the TPP but has **no technical means** to verify:
> 1. How the TPP obtained the VP Token (secure retrieval?)
> 2. Whether the TPP correctly displayed transaction data to the user
> 3. Whether the TPP used secure response modes (e.g., `dc_api.jwt`)

**Community Feedback** ([Discussion #439](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15134339)):

> "The ARF describes several challenges that come with remote presentation flows (chapter 4.4.3.1) and how they might be mitigated by the use of the DC-API. However, in the Third-Party-Requested flow, the final verifier AKA the bank has no information how the VP was obtained by a third party [...] it might make sense to include relevant request parameters like `response_mode=dc_api.jwt` in the key binding JWT."
> — @senexi, Dec 2025

**TS12 Team Response**: "@senexi thank you for this proposal, sounds reasonable, we will think if this could be a new requirement in TS12 possibly." — @tmielnicki

**Proposed Mitigation** (not yet in spec):

```json
// KB-JWT with response_mode claim (proposed)
{
  "aud": "x509_san_dns:psp.example.com",
  "iat": 1741269093,
  "jti": "deeec2b0-3bea-4477-bd5d-e3462a709481",
  "nonce": "bUtJdjJESWdmTWNjb011YQ",
  "transaction_data_hashes": ["OJcnQQ..."],
  "response_mode": "dc_api.jwt",  // ← NEW: Indicates secure retrieval
  "amr": [{"knowledge": "pin_6_or_more_digits"}, {"inherence": "fingerprint_device"}]
}
```

---

**Liability Framework (PSD2 Art. 73-74)**

For unauthorized transactions in the TPP flow:

| Scenario | Liable Party | Evidence Burden |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Unauthorized by user | ASPSP (bank) | Immediate refund |
| PISP caused the issue | PISP → compensates ASPSP | PISP bears proof burden |
| Authentication code valid but user denies | PISP must prove authorization | Transaction logs, consent records |

**PSP Risk Mitigation Recommendations**:

1. **Log Everything**: Store original `transaction_data`, received VP Token, verification results
2. **Require Signed Requests**: Only accept TPP transactions via JAR (JWT-secured requests)
3. **Verify TPP Registration**: Check EBA TPP Register before accepting
4. **Monitor Anomalies**: Flag mismatches between TPP-declared and hash-verified amounts
5. **Await TS12 Updates**: Implement `response_mode` verification when standardized

#### [Article 5(1)(d)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#005.001) — Authentication code invalidation on change

> "(d) any change to the amount or the payee results in the invalidation of the authentication code generated."

**Core Requirement**: This is the final pillar of dynamic linking—ensuring that authentication codes cannot be reused, replayed, or applied to modified transactions. Unlike Art. 5(1)(c) which is PSP-verified, this requirement is **cryptographically enforced** by the wallet's signature mechanism.

| Protection Type | Fulfillment | Reference | Implementation |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Change Invalidation** | ✅ Wallet | [TS12 §3.6](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications) | SHA-256 hash of transaction data in KB-JWT |
| **Replay Protection** | ✅ Wallet | TS12 §3.6 | Unique `jti` claim per presentation |
| **Time-Bound Validity** | ⚠️ PSP | TS12 §3.6 | PSP MAY reject stale `iat` timestamps |
| **Nonce Binding** | ✅ Wallet | OID4VP | `nonce` from request echoed in KB-JWT |

**Status**: ✅ **Cryptographically Enforced** with multiple defense layers

---

**Deep Dive: How Change Invalidation Works**

The guarantee is achieved through **cryptographic hash binding**:

**Cryptographic Security Properties**:

| Property | Requirement | SHA-256 Status | Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **Collision Resistance** | Attacker cannot find two different payloads with same hash | ✅ 128-bit security | Cannot forge matching transaction |
| **Pre-image Resistance** | Attacker cannot reverse hash to find payload | ✅ 256-bit security | Cannot deduce transaction from leaked hash |
| **Second Pre-image Resistance** | Given one payload, cannot find another with same hash | ✅ 128-bit security | Cannot substitute transactions |

---

**Multi-Layer Replay Protection**

Art. 5(1)(d) implicitly requires that old authentication codes cannot be replayed. TS12 provides **four independent mechanisms**:

| Layer | Claim | Protection |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1. Transaction Hash** | `transaction_data_hashes` | Different transaction → different hash → different signature |
| **2. Unique ID** | `jti` | Fresh cryptographically random value per presentation |
| **3. Timestamp** | `iat` | PSP MAY reject presentations older than threshold (e.g., 5 min) |
| **4. Nonce** | `nonce` | RP-provided value echoed in KB-JWT; prevents cross-session replay |

**TS12 §3.6 Specification**:
> "**`jti`**: **REQUIRED** A fresh, cryptographically random value with sufficient entropy, as defined in [RFC7519]. This value **SHALL** be unique for each presentation. Once verified, it serves as the Authentication Code required by [PSD2]."

**Industry Comparison** (EMV ARQC):
EMV chip cards use a similar approach—the Authorization Request Cryptogram (ARQC) is computed by hashing transaction data (amount, currency, merchant ID) and signing with the card's private key. Any modification invalidates the cryptogram.

---

**Edge Case: JSON Canonicalization**

**Potential Issue**: The `transaction_data_hashes` is computed over the JSON payload. If wallet and PSP serialize JSON differently (key order, whitespace), hash verification could fail even for legitimate transactions.

**TS12 Approach**: The hash is computed over the **base64url-encoded** `transaction_data` string as received in the request. This means:
- The wallet hashes the *exact bytes* received from the PSP
- No canonicalization is applied (like JCS)
- PSP must preserve the exact byte sequence when verifying

**Risk**: If a TPP or intermediary re-serializes the JSON differently, the hash will not match.

**Recommendation**: PSPs should:
1. Store the original base64url-encoded `transaction_data` string
2. Compare hash against that exact string, not re-serialized JSON

---

**Time-Bound Validity Gap**

While `iat` (issued-at) is included in the KB-JWT, **TS12 does not mandate a maximum validity period**. Industry practice suggests 5 minutes for payment authentication codes.

**Current TS12 §3.6**:
> "The `iat` (issued at) claim of the KB-JWT **MAY** be used by a Relying Party to restrict the timeframe."

| Aspect | Specification | Industry Practice |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Maximum validity | ❌ Not specified | 5 minutes typical |
| Clock skew tolerance | ❌ Not specified | ±30 seconds typical |
| Expiry (`exp`) claim | ❌ Not required | Some PSPs use this |

**Recommendation**: SCA Attestation Rulebooks SHOULD specify:
- Maximum `iat` age (e.g., 300 seconds)
- Clock skew tolerance (e.g., 60 seconds)

#### [Article 5(2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#005.002) — Security measures for dynamic linking (CIA triad)

> "For the purpose of paragraph 1, payment service providers shall adopt security measures which ensure the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of each of the following: (a) the amount of the transaction and the payee throughout all of the phases of the authentication; (b) the information displayed to the payer throughout all of the phases of the authentication including the generation, transmission and use of the authentication code."

**Core Requirement**: This article mandates the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Authenticity, Integrity) across **all phases** of SCA:

| Phase | Description | Key Security Concern |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Generation** | Transaction data created by PSP/RP | Data origin authenticity |
| **Transmission** | Data sent to wallet via network | Man-in-the-middle attacks |
| **Display** | User reviews amount/payee on screen | Overlay attacks, display manipulation |
| **Use** | User confirms and signs transaction | Transaction tampering |

**Compliance Matrix**:

| Security Property | Phase | Fulfillment | Reference | Implementation |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Transmission | ✅ Wallet | [OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html), [HAIP](https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-1_0.html) | TLS 1.2+ for all communications |
| **Confidentiality** | Transmission | ✅ Wallet | [TS12 §3.5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications) | Encrypted presentation requests (JAR) RECOMMENDED |
| **Confidentiality** | At-rest | ⚠️ Gap | — | Transaction data in memory; no explicit secure storage requirement |
| **Authenticity** | Generation | ✅ Wallet | [OID4VP §6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) | RP must sign request (JAR); wallet verifies signature |
| **Authenticity** | Response | ✅ Wallet | [TS12 §3.6](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications) | KB-JWT signed by WSCA-protected key |
| **Integrity** | Transmission | ✅ Wallet | TLS | HMAC/AEAD integrity via TLS record layer |
| **Integrity** | Display→Sign | ✅ Wallet | [TS12 §3.3](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications) | `transaction_data_hashes` binds displayed data to signature |
| **Integrity** | Display | ⚠️ Device | — | **Overlay attack protection** delegated to OS/device security |

**Status**: ⚠️ **Mostly Supported** — Display integrity (WYSIWYS) depends on device security

---

**Deep Dive: "What You See Is What You Sign" (WYSIWYS)**

The EBA introduced dynamic linking specifically to prevent **social engineering attacks** where attackers manipulate what users see vs. what they sign. Art. 5(2)(b) requires that "the information displayed to the payer" maintains CIA **throughout all phases**.

**TS12 Implementation of WYSIWYS**:

**TS12 §3.3.1 Display Rendering Requirements**:
- Wallet MUST display transactional data in "clear, understandable and accurate manner"
- Hierarchy levels (1-4) control prominence of amount/payee display
- Level 1 = "MUST be _prominently_ displayed on the main transaction confirmation screen"
- `affirmative_action_label` and `denial_action_label` controlled by Attestation Provider

**ARF HLR Coverage**:
- **SUA_02**: Rulebook specifies "displaying the data to the User when obtaining consent for signing"
- **SUA_06**: Wallet can customize dialogue messages (font, color, position) per Rulebook

---

**Gap Analysis: Overlay Attack Protection**

**The Problem**: Android overlay attacks (e.g., banking trojans like GM Bot, Godfather) can draw fake UI elements over the wallet's transaction screen, showing "€15.00" while the actual transaction is "€1,500.00".

**Industry Best Practices** (from security vendors):

| Mitigation | Description | EUDI Wallet Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)** | Detects if app window is obscured | ❌ Not in reference implementation |
| **Overlay detection API** | Android `FLAG_WINDOW_IS_PARTIALLY_OBSCURED` | ❌ Not explicitly required |
| **Secure display mode** | TEE-rendered transaction confirmation | ❌ Not in ARF/TS12 |
| **Certificate pinning** | Prevents MitM on transmission | ✅ Implicit via TLS best practices |
| **Device integrity checks** | Detect rooted/jailbroken devices | ⚠️ Wallet attestation covers this |

**EBA Guidance**: The EBA has clarified that SMS-based dynamic linking is insufficient because "confidentiality and integrity of payment information cannot be adequately protected through this channel." The same principle applies to device displays vulnerable to overlay attacks.

**Recommendation**: Wallet implementations for PSD2-regulated payments SHOULD:
1. Detect screen overlay conditions and refuse to process transactions
2. Consider TEE-based secure display for high-value transactions
3. Implement app shielding/RASP for production deployments

---

**At-Rest Confidentiality Gap**

Art. 5(2)(a) requires confidentiality "throughout all phases." However:

- Transaction data received in presentation request is processed in memory
- No explicit requirement for encrypted storage of pending transaction data
- If device is compromised, transaction details could be extracted before user approval

**Mitigation**: This is partially addressed by:
- Short transaction lifecycle (data only exists during approval flow)
- Device-level encryption (FDE/FBE on iOS/Android)
- WSCA/WSCD isolation protects signing keys, not transaction display data

#### [Article 5(3)(a)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R0389#005.003) — Batch file payment exception

> "For the purpose of paragraph 1(b) and where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 the following requirements for the authentication code shall apply: (a) in relation to a card-based payment transaction for which the payer has given consent to the exact amount of the funds to be blocked pursuant to Article 75(1) of that Directive, the authentication code shall be specific to the amount that the payer has given consent to be blocked and agreed to by the payer when initiating the transaction; (b) in relation to payment transactions for which the payer has given consent to execute a batch of remote electronic payment transactions to one or several payees, the authentication code shall be specific to the total amount of the batch of payment transactions and to the specified payees."

**Status**: ⚠️ Partial (Single Payee Only)

**Context**: TS12 supports recurring payments to a single payee with:
- `recurrence.number`: Count of payments
- `mit_options.total_amount`: Total across all payments

**Gap**: Multi-payee batch (e.g., payroll) is NOT supported. TS12 has no `payees[]` array.

**Workaround**: For multi-payee batches, PSP must trigger individual SCA per payee or display summary ("Payroll: €X to Y employees").

|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| ⚠️ **Gap** | — | Multi-payee batch not specified in TS12 v1.0 |

**Status**: ✅ Fully Supported

**Context**:
- **Loss**: User contacts Wallet Provider (or PSP) to revoke SCA attestation → key becomes invalid
- **Theft**: Device lock + biometric required; remote wipe available
- **Copying**: Private keys are non-extractable (hardware protection)

**Wallet Recovery Procedure** (ARF Topic N):

After device loss/theft, wallet recovery does NOT transfer private keys. Instead:

1. **Migration Object**: Encrypted blob containing attestation metadata (NOT private keys)
2. **Key Non-Exportability**: WIAM_20 mandates private keys never leave WSCA/WSCD
3. **Recovery = Re-issuance**: User must request **new** SCA attestation from PSP on new device
4. **LoA Maintained**: Migration preserves Level of Assurance High

This means the old possession element (lost device's key) is permanently invalidated, and a fresh key is generated on the new device.

**Encryption key source**: [`KeystoreController.kt`](reference-impl/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui/business-logic/src/main/java/eu/europa/ec/businesslogic/controller/crypto/KeystoreController.kt)

```kotlin
// Lines 90-118: Key generation in Android Keystore
private fun generateSecretKey(alias: String, userAuthenticationRequired: Boolean) {
    val keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES, "AndroidKeyStore")
    val builder = KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(
        alias,
        KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT or KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT
    ).apply {
        setKeySize(256)
        setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM)
        setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE)
        // ...
    }
    keyGenerator.init(builder.build())
    keyGenerator.generateKey()
}
```

#### iOS: Keychain with Hardware Encryption

The iOS reference implementation stores the PIN in the **iOS Keychain**, which provides hardware-backed encryption via the Secure Enclave on modern devices:

**File**: [`KeychainPinStorageProvider.swift`](reference-impl/eudi-app-ios-wallet-ui/Modules/logic-authentication/Sources/Storage/KeychainPinStorageProvider.swift)

```swift
// Lines 30-31: PIN stored directly in Keychain (encrypted by iOS)
func setPin(with pin: String) {
    keyChainController.storeValue(key: KeyIdentifier.devicePin, value: pin)
}
```

**Keychain configuration**: [`KeyChainController.swift`](reference-impl/eudi-app-ios-wallet-ui/Modules/logic-business/Sources/Controller/KeyChainController.swift)

```swift
// Lines 75-80: Biometry-protected items use device-only accessibility
try self.keyChain
    .accessibility(
        .whenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly,
        authenticationPolicy: [.touchIDAny]
    )
    .set(UUID().uuidString, key: self.biometryKey)
```

**Status**: ✅ Fully Supported

**Context**: For remote SCA attestation issuance:
1. User authenticates to wallet (meets SCA requirement)
2. Wallet generates proof of user authentication
3. PSP verifies and issues attestation

This is the "bootstrap" SCA — using existing wallet authentication to issue new SCA attestations.

# Part IV: Appendices

*The following appendices provide additional technical context. The compliance mapping in Parts I, II, and III is authoritative.*

## Appendix A: mDOC Protocol Gap Analysis

### Current Status

TS12 v1.0 explicitly states (Section 1.2):

> "This version of the document focuses on [SD-JWT-VC] format and [OID4VP] presentation protocol only."

### Implications

| Aspect | SD-JWT-VC (TS12 v1.0) | mDOC (Future) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| Format | SD-JWT | ISO 18013-5 CBOR |
| Protocol | OID4VP | ISO 18013-5 / OID4VP |
| Authentication Code | KB-JWT with `jti` | `DeviceResponse` with `DeviceSignature` |
| Transaction Data | `transaction_data_hashes` | `IntentToRetain` / custom elements |

### Roadmap

A future TS12 version is expected to add mDOC support. The compliance mapping in this document applies to mDOC flows mutatis mutandis — the `DeviceSignature` over session data serves the same function as the KB-JWT signature.

---

## Appendix B: TPP Scenario Coverage

> 📌 **Note**: This analysis is now integrated into [Article 5(1)(a)](#article-51a--payer-awareness) in the main compliance matrix.

### Two SCA Flow Types

TS12 §2.1 defines two scenarios:

1. **Issuer-Requested Flow**: RP = User's PSP (e.g., bank initiates SCA for login)
2. **Third-Party-Requested Flow**: RP = TPP (e.g., PISP initiates SCA for payment)

### Schema Support

The TS12 JSON schemas include explicit TPP objects:

**PISP Object** (payment flow):
```json
{
  "pisp": {
    "name": "PaymentApp",
    "id": "PISP-ID-123",
    "bic": "PISPDEFF"
  }
}
```

**AISP Object** (account access flow):
```json
{
  "aisp": {
    "name": "AccountAggregator",
    "id": "AISP-ID-456"
  }
}
```

### UI Implications

When a TPP initiates SCA, the Wallet displays both:
- The TPP name (e.g., "PaymentApp")
- The underlying PSP name (from attestation issuer)

This ensures user awareness per RTS Art. 5(1)(a).

---

## Appendix C: Accessibility Requirements

*Note: Wallet recovery procedures are documented inline at [Article 7(1)](#article-71) since they directly address the RTS requirement for loss/theft mitigation.*

### EU Accessibility Compliance (ARF Topics 8 & 54)

| Requirement | Standard | ARF HLR |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Web Accessibility Directive | EN 301 549 | AS-WP-54-001 |
| European Accessibility Act | 2019/882 | AS-WP-54-002 |
| WCAG Level | 2.2 AA | Chapter 8 |

For SCA specifically, SUA_06 mandates adaptable dialogue elements (font size, colours, button labels) — enabling accessible SCA flows.

### Key Stakeholder Feedback

#### Mastercard / WE BUILD LSP (Nov 27, 2025)
[Comment link](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15096762)

Proposed **payee structure enhancements** relevant to Art. 5(1)(a) (payer awareness):

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `payee_id` | REQUIRED | Identifier understood by payment system |
| `payee_name` | REQUIRED | Name displayed to payer |
| `payee_website_url` | OPTIONAL | E-commerce site URL |
| `payee_logo_url` | OPTIONAL | Visual identification |
| `estimated_amount` | OPTIONAL | Indicates if amount is estimated vs final |
| `payment_type` | OPTIONAL | `ONE_OFF` or `RECURRING` |
| `payment_summary` | OPTIONAL | Human-readable order summary |

**Compliance Relevance**: Enhances Art. 5(1)(a) by providing richer payer awareness UI.

#### ETPPA - European Third Party Provider Association (Nov 2 & Nov 22, 2025)
[Comment 1](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-14850895) | [Comment 2](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15045566)

Key points on **TPP (AISP/PISP) integration**:

1. **Embedded SCA ("Third-party-requested")**: TPPs intend to initiate signed payment requests via PSD2 APIs (Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 XS2A) with SCA proof from EUDI Wallet

2. **Requested new transaction type**: `urn:eudi:sca:consents:1` for AISP consent capture (in addition to existing `payment`, `login_risk_transaction`, `emandate`)

3. **Non-discrimination principle**: ETPPA emphasizes PSD2 parity — SCA Attestation Providers "must not discriminate between Third-party-requested and Issuer-requested attestation types"

4. **API alignment**: Requested alignment with Berlin Group JSON, ISO 20022 PAIN.001/PAIN.009 formats

**Compliance Relevance**: Direct evidence of industry expectation that Art. 97(1) TPP triggers work via TS12.

[Comment](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15133961)

Proposed reusing OIDC **`amr` claim** instead of `authentication_factors`:

> "OpenID Connect Core already defines the claim `amr` (Authentication Methods References)... It would make sense to reuse / reference that claim."

**Status**: TS12 v1.0 uses `amr` array — proposal was adopted.

**Compliance Relevance**: Confirms Art. 4(1) factor reporting via standard OIDC claim.

#### senexi — DC-API Verification (Dec 2, 2025)
[Comment](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15134339)

Raised concern about **Third-Party-Requested flow verification**:

> "In the Third-Party-Requested flow, the final verifier AKA the bank has no information how the VP was obtained by a third party... It might make sense to include relevant request parameters like `response_mode=dc_api.jwt` in the key binding JWT."

**Maintainer Response**: "sounds reasonable, we will think if this could be a new requirement in TS12 possibly"

**Compliance Relevance**: Open issue for PSP verification of TPP flow integrity.

#### Fime / APTITUDE LSP (Dec 4, 2025)
[Comment](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15157531)

Proposed **PSD3-forward enhancements**:

1. **SCA metadata for expressing authentication strength**: Allow ASPSPs to specify minimum factor requirements
2. **Required display vs advisory**: Clearer distinction between mandatory display elements and optional hints
3. **Risk context metadata**: Optional `transaction_context` and `risk_hint` fields for high-risk transaction UI

**Maintainer Response**: "Your proposals are taken for consideration for future versions of TS12"

**Compliance Relevance**: Forward-looking for Art. 18 (risk analysis) integration.

#### Wicpar — Technical Issues (Jan 4, 2026)
[Comment](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions/439#discussioncomment-15405623)

Identified technical issues in TS12 v1.0:

1. **Section 4.1.2**: `transaction_data_types` described as "array" but is JSON object
2. **#integrity placement**: Proposed that `#integrity` fields should be sibling keys to protected fields (per SD-JWT-VC §7)

**Compliance Relevance**: Technical accuracy for implementers.

### Unanswered Questions (Open Issues)

| Topic | Status | Relevance |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `jti` as authentication code interpretation | **Not explicitly discussed** | Art. 4(2) |
| mDOC format support | Explicitly deferred to future version | Art. 4 |
| AISP consent transaction type | **Requested by ETPPA, not yet added** | Art. 97(1)(a) |
| DC-API mode verification | Under consideration | TPP flow integrity |

## Appendix E: SCA Attestation Rulebook Status

### Current Status (January 2026)

| Document | Status | Owner |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **TS12** (Technical Specification) | ✅ Published v1.0 | EU Commission / eIDAS Expert Group |
| **SCA Attestation Rulebook** | ❌ Not yet published | Industry (EPC, EMVCo, Payment Schemes) |

### What TS12 Does vs What the Rulebook Will Do

| Aspect | TS12 | SCA Attestation Rulebook |
|--------|------|--------------------------|
| **Scope** | Protocol and transport ("pipes") | Data schemas and semantics ("content") |
| **Defines** | OID4VP flow, KB-JWT structure, `transaction_data` parameter | Field definitions (IBAN, amount format, payee structure) |
| **Author** | EU Commission / Member States | Industry (EPC for SEPA, EMVCo for cards) |
| **Status** | Published | Drafting/Consultation phase |

### TS12 Explicit Delegation

TS12 v1.0 explicitly states:

> "The structures of the SCA Attestations to be used in conjunction with this specification are to be **specified in related SCA Attestation Rulebooks**."

And:

> "This document is complemented by related SCA Attestation Rulebooks, that may specify:
> - transactional data schema
> - visualisation hierarchy
> - ..."

### Expected Rulebook Authors

| Payment Type | Expected Authority | Scope |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **SEPA Payments** | European Payments Council (EPC) | SCT, SCT Inst, SDD — defines IBAN, BIC, amount, remittance info fields |
| **Card Payments** | EMVCo / Visa / Mastercard / National Schemes | Card number, CVV handling, 3DS integration |
| **Other** | TBD | Crypto, CBDC, etc. |

### Timeline

- **TS12**: Available now (v1.0/v1.1)
- **SCA Rulebook(s)**: No official publication date announced
- **Expected**: Must be published before EUDI Wallet go-live (target: late 2026)
- **Current phase**: Likely in drafting/consultation within EPC working groups

### Implications for This Assessment

Items marked **🔶 Rulebook** in this assessment cannot be fully evaluated until the rulebook is published. These include:

| Provision | What Rulebook Will Clarify |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Art. 4(4)(b) Lockout | Wallet-level lockout requirements beyond OS defaults |
| Art. 4(4)(d) Session timeout | Wallet-side timeout requirements (if any) |
| Art. 8(2) Knowledge complexity | PIN length/complexity requirements for SCA attestations |
| Batch payments | Multi-payee schema definition (if supported) |

### How to Track Progress

1. Monitor [TS12 GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/discussions)
2. Watch EPC publications for SEPA SCA rulebook drafts
3. Check EMVCo specifications for card-based SCA schemas

| **2.7** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **EUR-Lex link fix**: Updated all anchors from `#d1eXXX-XX-1` to working `#art_X` format (verified via browser). Removed historical annotations (`*(integrated from Appendix X)*`). |
| **2.8** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Paragraph-level deep links**: Updated paragraph references to use `#XXX.YYY` format (e.g., Art. 97(2) → `#097.002`). Article-level headers retain `#art_X` format. |
| **2.9** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **TS12 anchor fix**: Corrected guessed anchors to actual section names (`#36-presentation-response`, `#43-payload-object`, `#431-payment-confirmation`). Fixed misattributed ES256 ref to OID4VP/HAIP. |
| **3.0** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Appendix G removal**: Inlined all reference implementation evidence into respective article sections. Moved repository links to header. Renumbered Appendix H → G. |
| **3.1** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **mDOC format notes**: Added warnings to Art. 97(2), 4(1), 4(2), 5(1)(b) that KB-JWT claims (`amr`, `jti`, `transaction_data_hashes`) are SD-JWT-VC only. TS12 v1.0 does not specify mDOC equivalents. |
| **3.2** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Appendix B removal**: Deleted Auth Code Interpretation appendix (content inline in Art. 4(2)). Renumbered C→B, D→C, E→D, F→E, G→F. Now 6 appendixes (A-F). |
| **3.3** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Terminology moved to top**: Moved definitions from Appendix A to after Executive Summary. Removed Appendix A, renumbered B→A through F→E. Now 5 appendixes (A-E). |
| **4.0** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Two use case model**: Added "Scope: Two SCA Use Cases" section. Issuance/Binding (OID4VCI) vs Usage/Authentication (OID4VP). Renamed Part II to "SCA Authentication (Usage)". |
| **4.1** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **PIN disclosure remediation**: Added detailed remediation guidance for Art. 4(3)(a) gap (PIN-specific error messages). |
| **4.2** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **ARF v2.7.3 update**: Updated ARF reference to v2.7.3. Added local regulatory source paths. |
| **4.3** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Part III: Issuance/Binding**: Added Chapter IV coverage (Articles 22-27). Credential creation, user association, delivery, renewal, revocation. Appendices renumbered to Part IV. |
| **4.4** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Deep-dive evidence**: Art. 22(2)(b) PIN storage with code samples (Android AES-GCM, iOS Keychain). Art. 22(2)(c) private key non-extractability with WIAM_20/WUA_09 HLR quotes. |
| **4.5** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Terminology cross-reference**: Added PSD2→EUDIW mapping table explaining PSC, Authentication Code, Dynamic Linking equivalents. Visual diagram of VP Token structure as Authentication Code. |
| **4.6** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **PSC definition expansion**: Clarified that PSCs include ALL SCA elements (PIN, biometric, AND private key + attestation) per PSD2 Art. 4(31). Updated Art. 22(1), 23, 26, 27 contexts to explicitly reference all PSC types. |
| **4.7** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Critical gap: PIN lockout missing**: Identified that reference implementation has NO PIN lockout mechanism (Art. 4(3)(b)). Unlimited PIN retries allowed. OS biometric is compliant (5 attempts), but wallet PIN bypasses this. Added detailed evidence from `QuickPinInteractor.kt` (Android) and `QuickPinInteractor.swift` (iOS). Provided remediation code pattern. |
| **4.8** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Art. 5(2) WYSIWYS deep-dive**: Complete rewrite of Art. 5(2) section with phase-by-phase CIA analysis (Generation, Transmission, Display, Use). Added WYSIWYS principle explanation, overlay attack gap analysis, industry best practices table (RASP, secure display, overlay detection). Identified at-rest confidentiality gap for transaction data. TS12 §3.3.1 display hierarchy levels documented. |
| **4.9** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Art. 5(1)(d) cryptographic deep-dive**: Complete rewrite with SHA-256 hash binding diagram, cryptographic security properties table (collision/pre-image resistance), 4-layer replay protection (hash, jti, iat, nonce). Added EMV ARQC comparison, JSON canonicalization edge case, time-bound validity gap analysis. Recommendation for SCA Attestation Rulebooks to specify max `iat` age. |
| **4.10** | 2026-01-27 | AI Analysis | **Art. 5(1)(c) PSP verification deep-dive**: Complete rewrite with 5-step verification algorithm diagram, Python pseudocode implementation, Issuer-Requested vs TPP flow comparison table with ASCII diagrams. Documented TPP verification gap from GitHub Discussion #439 with community feedback. Added PSD2 Art. 73-74 liability framework table and PSP risk mitigation recommendations. |
