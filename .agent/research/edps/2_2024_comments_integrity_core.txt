 HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING FORMAL COMMENTS:  
 
 1. Introduction and background 
 
1. On 13 August 2024, the European Commission consulted the EDPS  on the draft 
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as regards the integrity and core functionalities of European Digital Identity Wallets (‘the draft Implementing R egulation’ ). 
2. The draft Implementing R egulation is  accompanied by annexes
2. 
3. The objective of the draft Implementing R egulation is to lay down the rules for the 
integrity and core functionalities of  the European Digital Identity Wallets3. 
4. The draft Implementing R egulation is adopted pursuant to Article 5a(23) of 
Regulation (EU) No 910/20144, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 amending 
                                                      
1 OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39.  
2 The draft Implementing Regulation  is accompanied by four a nnexes specifying the list of standards referred to in Article 
8, the list of common embedded disclosure policies referred to in Article 10, the signature and seal formats to be supported 
by signature creation applications referred to in Article 12 and the  technical specifications for pseudonym generation 
referred to in Article 14, respectively .

 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity 
Framework  (‘the EDIW Regulation’)5. 
5. The EDPS previously issued formal comments on the proposal for the EDIW Regulation
6. As stated in the EDPS formal comments7, the envisaged technical 
implementation will ultimately determine whether all necessary data protection safeguards have been integrated in the EDIW Regulation or not. Indeed , the EDPS 
highlights that the technical architecture of the European Digital Identity Wallet 
cannot be fully assessed until all the relevant  implementing acts aiming at laying 
down technical specifications and reference standards are finalised. 
6. The EDPS further highlights that different aspects covered by the implementing 
regulations interact with and influence each other . For instance, aspects related to 
the core functionalities are related to the aspects concerning the interfaces of the European Digital Identity Wallet. The EDPS is concerned that the complexity of the 
overall archite cture, combined with a multiplicity  of implementing acts, make it 
impossible to fully assess the impact at this stage. 
7. These formal comments therefore do not preclude any additional comments by the 
EDPS in the future, in particular if further issues are identified or new information becomes available, for example as a result of the adoption of other related implementing or delegated acts
8. 
8. The present formal comments of the EDPS are issued in response to a consultation by the European Commission pursuant to Article 42(1) of EUDPR . 
9. Furthermore, these formal comments are without prejudice to any future action that may be taken by the EDPS in the exercise of his powers pursuant to Article 58 of the EUDPR and are limited to the provisions of the draft Implementing R egulation that 
are relevant from a data protection perspective.

8 In case of other Implementing or delegated acts with an impact on the protection of individuals’ rights and freedoms with 
regard to the processing of personal data, the EDPS would like to remind that he needs to be consulted on those acts as 
well. The same applies in case of future amendments that would introduce new or modify existing provisions that directly 
or indirectly concern the processing of personal data.

 2. Comments  
 
2.1. General comments  
 
10. Recital (1) of  the draft implementing regulation recalls that the European Digital 
Identity Wallets (‘wallets’) aim at facilitating access to services across Member States, 
for natural and legal persons, while ensuring the protection of personal data and 
privacy. F or th e sake of completeness, the EDPS recommends adding a recital 
explicitly recalling the applicability of the EU data protection legal framework  when 
processing personal data  within the scope of the draft Implementing Regulation . In 
particular the EDPS recomm ends making explicit reference to Regulation (EU) 
2016/679 (‘the GDPR’)9 and  Directive 2002/58/EC (‘ePrivacy Directive)10. 
 
11. The EDPS notes the absence of a reference to this consultation  in a recital of the draft 
Implementing R egulation. Therefore , the EDPS  recommends inserting suc h a 
reference in a recital  of the draft Implementing R egulation . 
 
2.1.1. The EDIW Regulation and data protection by design and by default  
 
12. The EDPS welcomes that the EDIW Regulation contains provisions11 enabling the 
implementation of the wallet in accordance with the principle of data protection by 
design and by default12. The draft I mplementing Regulation , in turn, should also foster 
the implementation of this principle, taking into account in particular  the state of the 
art of technology. 
13. In the following paragraphs, the EDPS recalls provisions of the EDIW Regulation that 
are important under a privacy and data protection viewpoint, having regard in particular to the principle of data protection by design  and by default. 
14. Article 5  of the EDIW  Regulation provides that “ [w]ithout prejudice to specific rules of 
Union or national law requiring users to identify themselves or to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use of pseudonyms that  are chosen by the user 
shall not be prohibited”
13. Article 5a(4)(b) of the EDIW Regulation further specifies that 
wallets must enable the users to generate pseudonyms and store them encrypted and 
locally within the  wallet, in a manner that is  user -friendly , transparent, and traceable 
                                                      
9 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural 
persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 
95/46/EC (General Dat a Protection Regulation), OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1– 88. 
10  Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal 
data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (D irective on privacy and electronic 
communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37– 47. 
11 Notably, under Article 5; Article 5a(4), letter (a); Article 5a(14); Article 5a(16), letter (a) and (b)  of the EDIW Regulation . 
12 Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (‘ the GDPR’).  
13 Article 5b(9)  of the E DIW Regulation further provides that r elying parties shall not refuse the use of pseudonyms, where 
the identification of the user is not required by Union or national law.

 by the user . This means that users should be able to use the wallet in such a way that 
a relying part y can, when this is necessary, have visibility on multiple transactions 
carried out by a  specific  user  without hav ing access t o the legal identity of the user.  
15. Article 5a(4)(a) of the EDIW Regulation provides that the wallet must ensure that 
selective disclosure of data to relying parties is possible. 
16. Article 5a(4) and (5) of the EDIW Regulation establish in particular the requirements 
for the security and integrity  of the wallet . The latter  needs to be uniquely  and 
securely  linked to a user,  whose personal identification data and attributes must  not 
be at risk of being tra nsferred to a wallet belonging to another user.  
17. The EDIW Regulation provides in Article 5a(14) that the users shall have full control 
of the use and of the data in their wallet . 
18. Article 5a(14) of the EDIW Regulation provides that the provider of the wallet must 
neither collect information about the use of the wallet which is not necessary for the 
provision of wallet  services, nor combine person identification data or any other 
personal data stored or relating to the use of the wallet  with personal data from  any 
other services offered by that provider or from third- party services which are not 
necessary for the provision of wallet  services, unless the user has expressly requested 
other wise.  
19. Article 5a(16)(a) of the EDIW Regulation provides that the technical framework of the 
European Digital Identity Wallet must not allow “ providers of electronic attestations 
of attributes or any other party, after the issuance of the attestation of attributes, to 
obtain data that allows transactions or user behaviour to be tr acked, linked or correlated, 
or knowledge of transactions or user behaviour to be otherwise obtained, unless explicitly authorised by the user ”. Although the EDIW Regulation does not expressly mention 
identity providers, the EDPS considers that the same limitation would also extend to 
identity providers  (as “any other party”).  
20. Article 5a(16)(b) of the EDIW Regulation requires that the technical framework of the 
European Digital Identity Wallet “ enable [s] privacy preserving techniques which ensure 
unlinkability, where the attestation of attributes does not require the identification of the 
user. ” This unlinkability should prevent the identification of a user when the user 
needs to present some of their attributes to relying parties in the context of  a 
transaction and identification is not necessary (e.g. to be authorised to the purchase of a product or service for adults only). The EDPS notes that the unlinkability should 
also apply:  
- among different transactions of the same user against the same re lying party (when 
this is not necessary  for the use -case); 
- between data held by the  provider of personal identification data and attestation of 
attributes , on the one hand, and data held by the parties relying on those attributes , 
on the other hand.

 21. Article 5b(3)  of the EDIW Regulation provides that relying parties must not request 
users to provide any data other than indicated in Article 5b(2)(c) (i.e. the indication 
of the data to be requested by the relying party from users  included in the registration 
of the relying party with the Member State where it is established).  
2.1.2. The d raft implementing regulation  and data protection by design and by     
default  
 
22. The EDPS considers that, in order to implement data protection by design and by 
default , the technical framework  of the European Digital Identity Wallet should make 
reference to available ‘state of the art’ privacy -enhancing techniques  (PETs) as 
mandatory measures. The EDPS recommends that the draft implementing regulation refer s to the use of PETs and include specifications on when (for which specific 
aspects) and how these PETs must be implemented. 
23. The EDPS considers that the ISO/IEC 18013- 5 standard  (on mobile driving licence), 
refer red to in Annex I to the draft Implementing Regulation, may not appropriately 
support the privacy features  of the European Digital Identity Wallet, in particular the 
requirement of unlinkability
14. The EDPS thus recommends to further assess the 
available technical solutions and standards to ensure full compliance with the requirements of the EDIW Regulation and the requirements of data protection by design and by default. 
24. The EDPS welcomes that requirements of the EDIW Regulation to ensure the 
integrity of the wallet, with a focus on cryptographic applications and material, their management and use, as well as the secure authentication of users and wallet integrity and authenticity management
15, have been referred to and implemented in 
the draft Implementing R egulation16. 
 
2.2.  Specific comments  
 2.2.1.  Transaction logs  
25. The EDPS observes that the draft Implementing Regulation provides that the wallet 
units
17 shall log  “at least” certain information on all transactions with wallet relying

15 Article 5a(4)(b) of the EDIW Regulation.  
16 Article 5 of the draft Implementing  Regulation, ‘Wallet secure cryptographic applications’.  
17 According to Article 2(2) of the draft Implementing Regulation , ‘wallet unit’ means a unique configuration of a wallet  
solution that includes wallet instances, wallet secure cryptographic applications a nd wallet secure cryptographic devices 
provided by a wallet provider  to an individual wallet user .

 parties18 and other wallet units, including the personal data presented in the 
transaction19. The EDPS welcomes this provision, as it provides users20 with an 
overview of their transactions, thereby upholding the data protection principle of 
transparency21. However, t he EDPS recommends specifying in the draft 
Implementing R egulation a maximum storage period for transaction logs referred to 
in Article 9 of the draft implementing regulation.  
2.2.2. Data recovery and portability  
 
26. The EDPS notes that Article 13(1) of the draft implementing regulation provides that wallet solutions
22 must support the backup and recovery of wallet user data  to enable 
migration to another wallet unit within the same wallet solution and electronic identification scheme. The data backed- up and restored must include the logs 
referred to in Article 9 of the draft implementing regulation, as well as any data needed to restore or re -issue person identification data and any electronic 
attestations of attributes to the new wallet unit. This function is needed to enable wallet users to request attestation providers
23 to re -issue the relevant data to another 
wallet unit,  for example, making it possible to recover lost wallet units or to transfer 
information from one wallet provider to another to exercise the user’s right to data portability
24. The EDPS recommends that Article 13(1) of the draft implementing 
regulation spec ifies a maximum storage period for the back -up data, or at least 
specifies criteria that would allow to determine the appropriate storage duration . 
 
2.2.3. Unlinkability  
 
27. An important privacy -enhancing feature  of the European Digital Identity Wallet 
consists in ensuring that the wallets are used without the user being trackable across 
different relying parties25. The technical infrastructure of the European Digital 
Identity Wallet should also be designed to ensure that only the minimal necessary 
                                                      
18 According to Article 2(11) of the draft Implementing Regulation , ‘wallet relying party’ means a relying party that intends 
to rely upon wallet units for the provision of public or private services by means of digital interaction.  
19 Article 9(1)(c) of the draft Implementing Regulation.  
20 According to Article 2(1) of the draft Implementing Regulation , ‘wallet user’ means a natural or legal person who is the 
subject of the person identification data associated with the wallet u nit that they are in control of. 
21 See also recital 9 of the draft Implementing Regulation.  
22 According to Article 2(3) of the  draft Implementing Regulation , ‘wallet solution’ means a combination of software, 
hardware, services, settings, and conf igurations, including wallet instances, one or more wallet secure cryptographic 
applications and one or more wallet secure cryptographic devices, and which is managed an d operated by a wallet provider.  
23 According to Article 2(7) of the  draft Implementing Regulation , ‘wallet provider’ means a natural or legal perso n who 
provides wallet solutions.

 amount of data  is transferred only to the authorised relying parties , while keeping 
the unlinkability between the different transactions . The draft implementing 
regulation should clearly and expressly r efer to the unlinkability requirement and 
provide for  appropriate specifications related to the implementation of this 
requirement26. 
 
2.2.4. Alternative identification and authentication means  
 
28. The EDPS recalls that  enjoyment of rights and access to services, particularly public 
services, as well as to employment or access to credit or other essential services , 
should not be restricted or hindered for persons not using the wallet. Where essential 
services are provided and access to those requires the use of the wallet, easily and 
promptly accessible alternatives  (other identification and authentication means) 
must be offered by the service provider  (as relying party). In other words, the use of 
the wallets must  be optional, and in no circumstance create grounds for any type of 
discrimination.  Natural persons should  not suffer disadvantages for not using the 
wallet. The EDPS recommends that this important requirement of the EDIW 
Regulation27 is fully taken into ac count also in the draft implementing regulation . For 
example, the draft implementing regulation could specify as functionality of the 
wallet that relying parties shall be able to provide information to the user of (at least 
some) alternative identification  and authentication means when requesting access to 
the user to their w allet and require relying parties to provide such information . 
 
2.2.5. Excessive access requests 
 
29. The European Digital Identity Wallet is a  system designed to store and/or provide 
access to a high quantity of and many different types of data, included personal data 
on the education, employment, health, of natural persons (as users). Article 5b(2) (c) 
of the EDIW Regulation provides that the re lying party, at registration, must provide 
information on the intended use  of the wallet, including “ an indication of the data to 
be requested ” from users. Article 5b(3 ) of the EDIW Regulation provides that relying 
parties must  not request users to provide  any data other than that indicated pursuant 
to Article 5(2 )(c). 
 
30. In this regard , the EDPS notes that the draft implementing regulation does not 
provide as functionality of the wallet the automated rejection of access requests  by a 
relying party  when the latter requests access for an intended use that has not been 
declared at registration and/or for types of data not indicated as object of the request 
                                                      
26 In this regard, see also paragraph 23 of these formal comments.  
27 Article 5a(15) of the EDIW Regulation .

 for the intended use at registration28. The EDPS considers that a functionality 
ensuring automated detection and blocking of excessive access requests  might be 
useful addition in the future and should be considered. 
 
31. However , to adequately address this issue, furt her work may also be necessary t o  
develop harmonised specification s of data elements which are appropriate for certain 
intended use(s) (use-case(s)). The definition of the permissible attribute requests  
could not only address the legal certainty and interoperability issues, but also 
enhance user’s control on their data an d mitigate risks of ‘ request fatigue’.

28 Such ‘abusive’ request by a relying party may include for instance  the unnecessary request for generation of and access 
to pseudonyms  to wallet units, that could be used to unnecessarily track users among different transaction s.
