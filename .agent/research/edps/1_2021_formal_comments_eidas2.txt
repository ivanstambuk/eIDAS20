Formal comments of the EDPS on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European 
Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards 
establishing a framework for  a European Digital Identity  
 
1. Introduction and background  
 
 On 3 June 2021, the EDPS was consulted according to Article 42(1) of Regulation 
2018/17251 on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the 
Council amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing a framework for 
a European Digital Identity.2 
 According to the Explanatory Memorandum, the draft Proposal would add ress 
shortcomings of the current Regulation3 such as the following:  
– limited coverage of eID schemes notified under the current Regulation,  
– limited offers of eIDAS authentication for cross -border users of public services,  
– limitation to public services, albe it a market demand exists in the private 
sector,  
– no coverage of electronic attributes, such as medical certificates or 
professional qualifications, making difficult pan -European legal recognition of 
such credentials in electronic form.  
 With the revised European Digital Identity framework , it is intended to give citizens and 
residents full confidence that it will offer the means of control who has access to their 
digital twin and to which data exactly.  
 A high level of security shall be awarded to all asp ects of digital identity provisioning, 
including the issuing of a European Digital Identity Wallet, and the infrastructure for 
the collection, storage and disclosure of digital identity data.  
 The Proposal expands the current eIDAS list of trust services wi th three new qualified 
trust services, namely the provision of electronic archiving services, electronic ledgers 
and the management of remote electronic signature and seal creation devices.  
 The proposed eIDAS Regulation is still comprised of two most important  parts, Chapter 
II (so far titled Electronic Identification) and Chapter III (Trust Services). However, 
Chapter II is now be divided in three Sections and also Chapter III gain s three Sections, 
                                                      
1 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the  protection 
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices 
and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision 
No 1247/2002/EC, OJ, 21.11.20 18, L.295, p.39 (Regulation 2018/1725).

 amounting to 11 Sections altogether. Chapters IV to V I are not relevant from a data 
protections perspective.  
 The envisaged technical implementation will ultimately determine whether additional  
data protection  safeguards should have been integrated in the Regulation or whether its 
design will be in accordance  with the GDPR4 at all. However, as was the case with 
Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 , the technical architecture cannot be fully assessed until 
the up to 28 Commission Implementing Acts are known that are planned to lay down 
technical specifications and refer ence standards. Those Acts are also likely to fall within 
the scope of Article 42(1) of Regulation 2018/1725 , and are likely to be subject to 
consultation of the EDPS in the future. Therefore, the present formal comments do not 
preclude any future additional comments by the EDPS, in particular if further issues are 
identified or new information becomes available, for example as a result of the adoption 
of related implementing or delegated acts.   
 The present formal comments of the EDPS are issued in response to the legislative 
consultation by the European Commission of 3 June 2021, pursuant to Article 42(1) of 
Regulation 2018/17257. In this regard, the EDPS welcomes the reference to this 
consultation in Recital 37 of the Proposal. They  are without pre judice to any future 
action that may be taken by the EDPS in the exercise of his powers pursuant to Article 
58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.  
 
 
2. Comments    
 
 The EDPS  welcome s the general concept of the Proposal which requires the European 
Digital Identity framework  to be fully in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Whether 
the specific safeguards are sufficient depends mainly on the technology to be used in 
implementing the proposal. In this respect, the EDPS  welcome s that the Proposal 
reaffirms in  its Recitals the full applicability of the GDPR, also for electronic ledgers and 
qualified electronic ledgers.5 This approach is fully in line with Article 25 of the GDPR 
which requires the choice of technology be made according to the data protection 
requirements, and not the other way around.  
 From the explanatory memorandum, especially on page 10 and 11, it can be derived that 
electronic ledgers as a trust service will not be a necessary element of the the European 
Digital Identity Wallet, but will be limited to specific use cases. The EDPS  appreciate s 
this clarification.  The EDPS  appreciate s that the explanatory memorandum confirms 
that Service Providers will need to comply with the GDPR also in use cases for electronic 
ledgers, and that nothing in the P roposal allows for a deviation from GDPR provisions.   
 Blockchain technology is one of those implementing electronic ledgers. Blockchain 
raises several compliance issues with the GDPR, such as data transfers outside the EU, 
the impossibility to delete or co rrect entries in a Blockchain etc. Therefore, the use of 
                                                      
4 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of 
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and 
repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Dat a Protection Regulation), OJ, 4.5.2016, p. 1.

 Blockchain technology may not be appropriate for all possible use cases and may require 
additional safeguards. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board has 
 in its Work Programme 2021/2022 .6 The 
EDPS  recommend s that those guidelines , once available,  be taken into account when 
considering blockchain based ledgers in the context of this Proposal.  
 The EDPS  welcome s that the European Digi tal Identity Wallet will give the user better 
and transparent control on what  data to share with whom for what  purposes. The 
technical solution envisaged would be able to solve problems of excessive data 
processing, as it would allow the data subject to actually reveal only those data that are 
necessary for a specific purpose. That means, if the purpose is age verification, the user 
could choose to submit his birth  date but withhold disclosing other personal information 
not relevant to the purpose. If the  purpose is identification, for example in the banking 
or telecommunications sector , as required by law, the user could reveal only those pieces 
of identity data  mandated by law  (without biometric identifiers , for example, if their 
processing is not explic itly required ). 
 The EDPS  further welcome s the explicit prohibition in the new Article 6a (7) for the issuer 
of the European Digital Identity Wallet to collect information about the use of the Wallet  
which are not necessary for the provision of the Wallet  services . This and the prohibition 
to combine person identification data for the Wallet with other data from any other 
service as well as the obligation to physically and logically separate the personal data for 
the provision of the Wallet services from a ny other data held  will increase the trust in the 
security and confidentiality of this technical solution.  
 In this context the EDPS  also welcome s that Article 6c(2) would establish a certification 
pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for certain requireme nts to European Digital 
Identification Wallets, including the prevention that trust service providers of qualified 
attestations of attributes could receive any information about the use of these attributes.  
The EDPS  understand s that also  this certification  is mandatory and will have no 
exculpatory effects . 
 Article 17 contains the tasks of the supervisory body and foresees cooperation with other 
supervisory authorities, such as those under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. According to this 
provision, data protectio
about the results of audits of qualified trust service providers, where personal data 
protection rules have been breached and about security breaches which constitute 
The EDPS  notes that the wording that seems to require the 
completion of an investigation, goes back to Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No  910/2014  
and constitutes already an improvement over that current version insofar as a personal 
data breach in the sense of Article 33 of the GDPR would now also trigger the duty to 
inform. However, the EDPS  draw s attention of the co -legislator to the fact that th e 
previous wording corresponded to a different role of data protection authorities, whereas 
Article 33 of the GDPR requires Controllers to notify qualifying data breaches without 
undue delay, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of them , offer ing

 supervisory authorities an active role during the investigations of a breach and in the 
choice of further measures. For this reason, it seems appropriate to align the wording of 
Article 17(4)(f) to point (c) of the same paragraph, where the national co mpetent 
authorities pursuant to the NIS2 Directive would be informed of a (suspected) security 
breach regardless of whether the results of an audit have found a breach. The data 
protection supervisory authorities should be informed whenever the supervisory  body 
receives information of a possible personal data breach.  
 For the same reason, Article 20(2) last sentence should also be aligned with  the GDPR 
and mandate immediate notification, regardless of whether the audit has been finished 
or is still ongoing.  
 The draft proposal introduces a unique and persistent identifier to be used by Member 
States to facilitate identity matching and ensure the unique identification for each user. 
This identifier would then inter alia be used when adding electronic attestations of 
attributes to a Wallet.  
 The EDPS  does appreciate the effort in Article 11a to enhance trust and integrity by 
reducing the risk of abuse or ambiguity errors. It should, however, be noted that this 
unique and p ersistent identifier constitutes another, additional category of data stored 
solely for the purpose of facilitating the usage of the Wallet . This interference with the 
rights and liberties of the data subject is not necessarily trivial; in some Member Stat es, 
unique identifiers have been considered unconstitutional in the past due to a violation 
of human dignity. Therefore, the EDPS  recommend s exploring alternative means to 
enhance the security of matching.  
 The EDPS  notice s that Article 45f further regulate s the use of personal data by Providers 
of qualified or non -qualified electronic attestation of attributes services. They shall not 
combine personal data relating to the provision of these services with personal data from 
any other services they offer, and  shall keep the data logically separate, in the case of 
personal data relating to the provision of qualified electronic attestation of attributes 
these prohibitions cann ot be circumvented by means of contractual clauses  or consent . 
The EDPS welcomes these prohibitions as a measure to prevent misuse of data and to 
increase trust in the system. For Providers of qualified electronic attestation of 
le 45f(4) even foresees that such services shall be provided under 
a separate legal entity, which, in combination with the prohibitions mentioned above, 
should be an effective mechanism to prevent conflicts of interest and unwarranted 
sharing of personal d ata.
