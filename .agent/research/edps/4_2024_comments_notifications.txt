 1. Introduction and background 
 
1. On 13 August 2024, the European Commission consulted the EDPS on draft 
Commission Implementing  Regulation  (EU) for the application of Regulation  (EU) No 
910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards notifications to 
the Commission concerning the European Digital Identity Wallet Ecosystem  (‘the 
draft Implementing  Regulation ’). 
2. The draft Implementing  Regulation  is accompanied by annexes
2. 
3. The objective of the draft Implementing  Regulation  is to is to establish the trust 
framework for the validation of: (1) the electronic registers used by a Member State 
to publish information on wallet relying parties registered in that Member State in 
accordance with Article 5b(5) of Regulation  (EU) No 910/2014 (‘registers’), the location 
of the registers, and the identification of the registrars;  (2) the identity of the 
registered wallet relying parties;  (3) the authenticity and validity of wallet units; (4) 
the identification of the wallet providers; (5) the authenticity of person identification

 4. The draft Implementing  Regulation  is adopted pursuant to Article 5a(23) of 
Regulation  (EU) No 910/20144, as amended by Regulation  (EU) 2024/1183 amending 
Regulation  (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity 
Framework  (‘the EDIW Regulation ’)5. 
5. The EDPS previously issued formal comments on the proposal for the EDIW 
Regulation6. As stated in the E DPS formal comments7, the envisaged technical 
implementation will ultimately determine whether all necessary data protection 
safeguards have been integrated in the EDIW Regulation  or not. Indeed, the EDPS 
highlights that the technical architecture of the E uropean Digital Identity Wallet 
cannot be fully assessed until all the relevant Implementing  acts aiming at laying 
down technical specifications and reference standards are finalised.  
6. The EDPS further highlights that different aspects covered by the Imple menting  
Regulation s interact with and influence each other. For instance, aspects related to 
the core functionalities are related to the aspects concerning the interfaces of the European Digital Identity Wallet. The EDPS is concerned that the complexity of  the 
overall architecture, combined with a  multiplicity  of Implementing  acts, make it 
impossible to fully assess the impact at this stage.  
7. These formal comments therefore do not preclude any additional comments by the EDPS in the future, in particular if further issues are identified or new information becomes available, for example as a result of the adoption of other related Implementing  or delegated acts
8. 
 
8. The present formal comments of the EDPS are issued in response to a consultation by the European Commission pursuant to Article 42(1) of EUDPR.  
9. Furthermore, these formal comments are without prejudice to any future action that may be taken by the EDPS in the exercise of his powers pursuant to Article 58 of the EUDPR and are limited to the provisions of the draft Implementing  Regulation  that 
are re levant from a data protection perspective.

8 In case of other implementing or delegated acts with an impact on the protec tion of individuals’ rights and freedoms with 
regard to the processing of personal data, the EDPS would like to remind that he needs to be consulted on those acts as 
well. The same applies in case of future amendments that would introduce new or modify exi sting provisions that directly 
or indirectly concern the processing of personal data.

 2. Comments  
 
2.1. General comments  
 
10. The  draft Implementing  Regulation  provides that the Commission must make 
available to Member States a secure electronic notification system, enabling Member 
States to notify the information on the bodies and mechanisms referred to in Article 
5a(18) of the EDIW Regulation9. The  Commission may request additional information 
from the member States to verify the notified information10. Member States must  
submit , through a secure electronic notification system , at least the information 
specified in Annex II of the draft Implementing  Regulation11. In this regard, the EDPS 
notes that some of the information required in Annex II may constitute  personal data 
within the meaning of Article 4, point (1), GDPR and Article 3, point (1), EUDPR. This 
may be the case for instance of names, contact emails and phone numbers of 
registrars12, of providers of wallet relying party access certificates13. 
 
11. Against this background , the EDPS recommends adding a recital referring to the 
applicability of the EU data protection legal framework (GDPR, EUDPR, as well as 
ePrivacy Directive) to the processing of personal data  in the context of the draft 
Implementing  Regulation . 
 
12. The EDPS also notes the absence of the reference to this consultation in a rec ital of 
the draft Implementing  Regulation . Hence, the EDPS recommends inserting such a 
reference in a recital of the draft Implementing  Regulation .

Identity Wallets in accordance with Article 5b(5) and the location of that list;  
(b) the bodies responsible for the provision of European Digital Identity Wallets in accordance with Article 5a(1);

(e) the mechanism by which to validate the authenticity and validity of European Digi tal Identity Wallets .” 
10 Article 4(3) of the  draft implementing regulation.

 2.2. Specific comments  
 
13. The EDPS notes that Annex I  to the  draft Implementing  Regulation  provides 
requirements for the secure electronic notification system and integrate a 
requirement to “ support appropriate access controls and access control management , 
delegating to the Member  States the power to grant access to competent 
representatives as regards the notifications”. Moreover, Article 5(3)(c) of the  draft 
Implementing  Regulation  provides the obligation to ensure that lists referred to in 
Article 5(2) and (3) can be accessed se curely by using state of the art transport layer 
encryption.  
 
14. Given the subject matter and the provisions of the draft Implementing  Regulation , 
which do not raise significant issues having regard to the protection of personal data, the EDPS has no comments  on the draft Implementing  Regulation .
