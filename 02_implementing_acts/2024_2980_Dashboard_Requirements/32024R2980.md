## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC \[OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.\], and in particular Article 5a(23) thereof,*

## Recitals

- (1) The European Digital Identity Framework established by Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 is a crucial component in the establishment of a secure and interoperable digital identity ecosystem across the Union. With the European Digital Identity Wallets ('wallets') being the cornerstone of the framework, it aims at facilitating access to services across Member States, while ensuring the protection of personal data and privacy.

- (2) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\], or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\] apply to all personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

- (3) Article 5a(23) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 mandates the Commission, where necessary, to establish relevant specifications and procedures. This is achieved by means of four Implementing Regulations, dealing with protocols and interfaces: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2982 \[Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2982 of 28 November 2024 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards protocols and interfaces to be supported by the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/2982, 4.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2982/oj).\], integrity and core functionalities: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2979 \[Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2979 of 28 November 2024 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the integrity and core functionalities of European Digital Identity Wallets (OJ L, 2024/2979, 4.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2979/oj).\], person identification data and electronic attestation of attributes: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2977 \[Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2977 of 28 November 2024 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards person identification data and electronic attestations of attributes issued to European Digital Identity Wallets (OJ L, 2024/2977, 4.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2977/oj).\], as well as the notifications to the Commission: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2980 \[Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2980 of 28 November 2024 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards notifications to the Commission concerning the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem (OJ L, 2024/2980, 4.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2980/oj).\]. This Regulation lays down the relevant requirements for Member States’ notifications of trusted entities that establish trustworthiness of the European Digital Identity Framework.

- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. To ensure the highest level of harmonisation among Member States for the development and certification of the wallets, the technical specifications set out in this Regulation rely on the work carried out on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Framework \[OJ L 210, 14.6.2021, p. 51, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2021/946/oj.\] and in particular the architecture and reference framework. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\], the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, the architecture and reference framework, and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

- (5) To meet the objective of establishing a transparent and reliable source of information for authenticating entities in the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem, such as wallet providers, providers of person identification data and wallet-relying parties, Member States should notify the required information to the electronic system provided by the Commission. In line with the approach taken by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1984 \[Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1984 of 3 November 2015 defining the circumstances, formats and procedures of notification pursuant to Article 9(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 289, 5.11.2015, p. 18, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj).\] defining the circumstances, formats and procedures of notification with respect to electronic identification schemes applicable to electronic identification means, information should be provided by the Member States to the Commission in English. In this manner, descriptions of electronic identification schemes are available in English for all such schemes, irrespective of whether they relate to electronic identification means or to wallets.

- (6) For the same objective of establishing information sources that enable the authentication of entities in the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem, the Commission should establish an infrastructure to make the information available to the public in a secure, human-readable, clear, and easily accessible manner, as well as in an electronically signed or sealed form suitable for automated processing, including by offering an application programming interface.

- (7) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, and delivered its opinion on 30 September 2024.

- (8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,
