- (2) In order to ensure equal treatment and ability to trust the result of the verification process, verifications should be carried out in an equivalent manner by all qualified trust service providers when issuing a qualified certificate or a qualified electronic attestation of attributes. In accordance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, a number of standards have been selected to meet these specific requirements. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service, while facilitating cross-border interoperability and the effective functioning of the internal market.

- (3) An adequate transitional period for qualified trust service providers should be provided for them to be able to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. With a view to ensuring a sufficient timeframe for the audit of trust service providers as regards compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, this Regulation should apply from 24 months as of its entry into force.

In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\], the Commission should review and update this Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.
