# Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2160 of 27 October 2025 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards reference standards, specifications and procedures for the management of risks to the provision of non-qualified trust services

## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.], and in particular Article 19a(2) thereof,*

## Recitals

(1) Non-qualified trust service providers play an important role in the digital environment by providing trust services that facilitate secure electronic transactions. Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 places fewer regulatory requirements on non-qualified trust service providers than on qualified trust service providers. However, all trust service providers are subject to requirements on security and liability to ensure due diligence, transparency and accountability of their operations and services.

(2) Non-qualified trust service providers can be considered important or essential entities in accordance with Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) (OJ L 333, 27.12.2022, p. 80, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj).]. Thus, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2690 [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2690 of 17 October 2024 laying down rules for the application of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 as regards technical and methodological requirements of cybersecurity risk-management measures and further specification of the cases in which an incident is considered to be significant with regard to DNS service providers, TLD name registries, cloud computing service providers, data centre service providers, content delivery network providers, managed service providers, managed security service providers, providers of online market places, of online search engines and of social networking services platforms, and trust service providers (OJ L, 2024/2690, 18.10.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2690/oj).] laying down technical and methodological requirements of cybersecurity risk management measures applies to them. However, the scope of the requirements laid down in Article 19a(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 relates to the risk management procedures concerning legal, business, operational and other direct or indirect risks to the provision of non-qualified trust services. To complement the risk management framework set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2690 and to enable a coherent approach to the management of all relevant types of risks, specifications and procedures concerning the management of those risks by non-qualified trust service providers should be laid down. Guidance provided by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or national competent authorities under Directive (EU) 2022/2555 can support non-qualified trust service providers in the design and implementation of appropriate risk management policies.

(3) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 19a(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where non-qualified trust service providers comply with the requirements set out in this Regulation. The reference standards referred to in the Annex should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. In order to ensure that non-qualified trust service providers manage legal, business, operational and other direct or indirect risks to the provision of the non-qualified trust service in accordance with Article 19a(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, non-qualified trust services providers should comply with the referenced elements of the standards as set out in the Annex and with the risk management requirements set out in this Regulation for the presumption of compliance.

(4) If a non-qualified trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in this Implementing Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. However, a non-qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.

(5) To ensure that the identified risks are adequately addressed, the risk management policies followed by non-qualified trust service providers should include procedures for risk documentation and evaluation, as well as for the identification, selection and implementation of appropriate risk treatment measures. The implementation of risk treatment measures should be continuously monitored. As regards the information that non-qualified trust service providers record and retain as part of their risk treatment measures, non-qualified trust service providers should ensure the integrity and confidentiality of such data. Moreover, to enhance transparency and to support supervisory activities, non-qualified trust service providers should publish the identity verification methods they apply. As not all identified risks may be fully addressed through their avoidance, mitigation or transfer to other entities, any residual risks should be approved by the management bodies of non-qualified trust service providers. Criteria for the acceptance of residual risks should be justified in a comprehensible manner.

(6) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).], the Commission should review and, if necessary, update this Implementing Regulation, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

(7) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

(8) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).] and delivered its opinion on 8 August 2025 [EDPS Formal comments on the draft Implementing Regulation as regards specifications and procedures for the management of risks to the provision of non-qualified trust services | European Data Protection Supervisor.].

(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,
