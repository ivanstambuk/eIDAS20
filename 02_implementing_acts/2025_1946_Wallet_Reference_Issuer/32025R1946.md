## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC \[OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.\], and in particular Articles 34(2) and Article 40 thereof,*

## Recitals

- (1) Qualified preservation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals ensure the long-term integrity, authenticity, proof of existence and accessibility of preservation evidence of those electronic signatures and electronic seals. This allows the demonstration of their legal validity over extended periods of time and guarantees that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes. These services are provided independently, or as a part of another qualified trust service such as qualified electronic archiving services.

- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 34(1a) and Article 40 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified preservation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service, as well as the ability to verify the qualified status and technical validity of the signatures and seals over time.

- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.

- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\], the Commission should review and update this Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

- (5) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

- (6) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\] and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.
