- (a) the preservation service shall preserve all information needed to check the qualified status of the electronic signature or seal that would not be publicly available until the end of the preservation period;
- (b) the preservation service shall ensure that, at any given time during the preservation period, the information preserved is such that, when provided as input to the process specified in clause 4.4 of ETSI TS 119172-4 [9], the output of this process clearly determines whether or not the digital signature or seal was, at the time of its preservation, technically suitable to implement an EU qualified electronic signature or EU qualified electronic seal.
