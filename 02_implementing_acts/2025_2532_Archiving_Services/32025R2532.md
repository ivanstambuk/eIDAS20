# Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2532 of 16 December 2025 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards reference standards and specifications for qualified electronic archiving services

## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC \[OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.\], and in particular Article 45j(2) thereof,*

## Recitals

- (1) By Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).\], a list of new trust services and qualified trust services, including the qualified electronic archiving service, was introduced in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. The Commission is to establish a list of reference standards and, where necessary, establish specifications for such services.

- (2) Electronic archiving is a service for the receipt, storage, retrieval and deletion of electronic data and electronic documents to ensure their durability and legibility as well as to preserve their integrity, confidentiality and proof of origin throughout the preservation period. Qualified electronic archiving services play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalents. To ensure that electronic data and electronic documents preserve the presumption of their integrity and of their origin for the duration of the preservation period by the qualified trust service provider, and to achieve a high level of transparency and confidence among all participants in the information lifecycle, it is necessary to establish a common set of specifications for qualified electronic archiving services.

- (3) To increase the evidentiary value, security and trustworthiness of qualified electronic archiving services, where electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time stamps are used to create, sign, seal or attest the date and time of, for example, archiving evidences, evidence records, records of events, records of the correct implementation of procedures, or archiving confirmation reports, qualified trust services should be used.

- (4) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 45j(2) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified electronic archiving services comply with the requirements set out in this Regulation. The reference standards for qualified electronic archiving services should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified electronic archiving services.

- (5) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.

- (6) In order to preserve the integrity and proof of origin of electronic data and electronic documents containing one or more qualified electronic signatures or seals, qualified electronic archiving services should use procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of those electronic signatures and seals beyond the technological validity period, at least throughout the preservation period.

- (7) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, the Commission should review and, if necessary, update this Regulation, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

- (8) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).\] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).\] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

- (9) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council \[Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).\] and delivered its opinion on 21 October 2025 \[EDPS Formal comments on the draft Implementing Regulation laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards reference standards and specifications for qualified electronic archiving services.\].

- (10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,

**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**
