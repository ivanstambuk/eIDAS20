A wallet solution may be located on the users’ devices and environments and the provider’s backend structure. A wallet unit should be understood as a specific setup of the wallet solution for an individual user.

Wallet secure cryptographic applications may be provided in various ways and to various kinds of wallet secure cryptographic devices.

For instance, wallet providers should consider state-of-the-art privacy mitigating measures in relation to wallet unit attestations, such as using ephemeral wallet unit attestations or batch issuance.

The information regarding the validity status of the wallet units should be made available in an interoperable manner, to ensure that it can be used by all wallet-relying parties. Moreover, for cases where wallet users lost their wallet units or no longer have control over it, wallet providers should enable wallet users to request the revocation of their wallet unit. To ensure the privacy and unlinkability, Member States should employ privacy preserving techniques also for the wallet unit attestation.
