In accordance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, a number of standards have been selected to meet these specific requirements. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors.

- (3) An adequate transitional period for qualified trust service providers should be provided for them to be able to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.
