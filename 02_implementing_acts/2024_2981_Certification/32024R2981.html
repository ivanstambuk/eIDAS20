In other cases, and in particular when these devices and platforms are provided by end users, providers should establish assumptions on the wallet solution’s operating environment, including on these devices and platforms, and implement measures to confirm that these assumptions are verified in practice. In order to ensure protection of critical assets through hardware and system software used to manage and protect cryptographic keys created, stored or processed by the WSCD, the WSCD needs to satisfy high standards of certification as reflected in international standards such as Common Criteria (‘EUCC’), established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/482 <a id="ntc8-L_202402981EN.000101-E0008" href="#ntr8-L_202402981EN.000101-E0008"

It is important to ensure the timely access to embedded secure elements for national eID means and wallets and to coordinate efforts by Member States in this area. The European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 46e(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (‘Cooperation Group’), should therefore establish a dedicated subgroup for this purpose. Consulting relevant stakeholders, this subgroup should agree on a joint roadmap for access to embedded secure elements to be considered by the Commission for the review report on the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. In order to facilitate the uptake of the wallet at national level, the Commission should furthermore, in cooperation with Member States, develop and continuously update a manual for use cases as part of the Architecture and Reference Framework.</p>

Assurance information comes in many different forms, including reports and certificates of conformity, which can be private, national, European or international, based on standards or on technical specifications.
