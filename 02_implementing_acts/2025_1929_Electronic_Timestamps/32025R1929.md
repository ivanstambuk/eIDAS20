## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.], and in particular Article 42(2) thereof,*

## Recitals

- (1) Qualified electronic time stamps play a crucial role in the digital environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalents. By binding date and time information to electronic data, qualified electronic time stamps help ensuring the accuracy of date and time they indicate and the integrity of digital documents to which the date and time are bound.

- (2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 42(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified trust services for the issuance of qualified time stamps comply with the standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. These standards should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust service and of the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source.

- (3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.

- (4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with Recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).], the Commission should review and update this Implementing Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

- (5) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj.] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

- (6) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).] and delivered its opinion on 06 June 2025.
