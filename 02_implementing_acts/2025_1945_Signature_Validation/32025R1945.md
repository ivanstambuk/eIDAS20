## Recitals

(1) Qualified electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals, advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates for electronic signatures and advanced electronic seals based on qualified certificates for electronic seals, provided their validity can be confirmed, ensure to relying parties the integrity and authenticity of the signed or sealed data, and enhance the certainty regarding the identity of the signatory or the seal creator.

(2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 32(1), Article 40, Article 32a(3) and Article 40a of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should apply where the processes for the validation of qualified electronic signatures, of qualified electronic seals, of advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates for electronic signatures and of advanced electronic seals based on qualified certificates for electronic seals comply with the technical standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors.

(4) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to all personal data processing activities under this Regulation.
