- (1) Qualified trust services for the management of remote qualified electronic signature creation devices and for the management of remote qualified electronic seal creation devices play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalents. Those qualified trust services contribute to a secure and trustworthy management of those remote devices on behalf of the signatories and creators of the seals, in a manner that guarantees that the conditions for qualified electronic signatures and qualified electronic seals are met.

- (2) To enhance the legal certainty and trustworthiness of qualified trust services for the management of remote qualified electronic signature creation devices and qualified trust services for the management of remote qualified electronic seal creation devices, qualified trust service providers providing those qualified services should comply with the standards set out in this Regulation.

- (3) These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust services, as well as ensuring that the signatories have sole control, with a high level of confidence, over the use of their electronic signature creation data, and that the creators of the seal have control over the use of their electronic seal creation data, respectively.

- (4) With a view to ensuring an adequate timeframe for the audit of trust service providers as regards compliance with the new requirements, this Regulation should apply from 24 months after its entry into force.
