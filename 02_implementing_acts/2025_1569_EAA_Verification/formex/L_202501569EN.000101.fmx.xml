Therefore, qualified electronic attestations of attributes and electronic attestations of attributes issued by or on behalf of a public sector body responsible for an authentic source should be able to be revoked, or alternative measures should be implemented to compensate for the risks related to non-revocability. Certain circumstances, such as the explicit request of the person to whom the electronic attestation of attributes was issued, or where it is known to the provider that there has been a compromise of the security or trustworthiness of the qualified electronic attestations of attributes, or where required by Union or national law, should lead to revocation by the provider of an electronic attestation of attributes. To safeguard the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection of the user, notably by appropriately minimising risks of link ability and traceability, providers of qualified electronic attestations of attributes and electronic attestations of attributes issued by or on behalf of a public sector body responsible for an authentic source, should set up revocation management policies that are privacy preserving.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>In order to facilitate cooperation among Member States and the establishment of a secure and interoperable digital identity ecosystem, including the cross-border recognition and interoperability of qualified electronic attestations of attributes and electronic attestations of attributes provided by or on behalf of a public sector body responsible for an authentic source, simplified administrative communication procedures need to be established among the relevant stakeholders, including the publication of information to swiftly identify the relevant public sector bodies. Member States should notify the relevant attributes to the Commission. Therefore, to ensure the timely, efficient, and interoperable verification of these attributes, the relevant notifications to the Commission should be at least in English as this facilitates its wide accessibility, assessment, and comprehension and at the same time enhances cooperation among the relevant stakeholders. However, translation of already existing documentation should not cause unreasonable administrative or financial burdens.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(7)</NO.P><TXT>To enable users and service providers to verify that electronic attestations of attributes issued by or on behalf of a public sector body responsible for an authentic source were indeed issued by or on behalf of that public sector body, Member States should notify those public sector bodies to the Commission. When notifying public sector bodies that issue electronic attestations of attributes in accordance with Article 45f and Annex VII of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, Member States are to provide a conformity assessment report confirming a level of reliability and trustworthiness equivalent to qualified trust service providers. However, unlike qualified trust service providers issuing qualified electronic attestations of attributes, for these public sector bodies, it is up to Member States how they ensure that the providers meet the requirements over time. To maintain a high level of trust in public sector attestations across the Union, Member States are therefore encouraged to share their best practices on how they ensure the continued reliability and trustworthiness through the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 46e(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (<QUOT.START CODE="2018" ID="QS0003" REF.END="QE0003"/>Cooperation Group<QUOT.END CODE="2019" ID="QE0003" REF.START="QS0003"/>).

The verification mechanisms should use electronic means suitable for automatic processing, and for obtaining responses as soon as possible from the verification point. This response should confirm if the attributes presented by the qualified trust service providers issuing qualified electronic attestations of attributes correspond to the attributes stored in relation to that user in the relevant authentic source and should specify the authentic source against which the verification was conducted. To avoid misconduct, such as unlawful or manifestly excessive verification requests, Member States may impose control mechanisms on the use of the verification points, where they deem this appropriate
