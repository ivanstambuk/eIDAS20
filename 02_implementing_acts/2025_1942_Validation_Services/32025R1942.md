## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.], and in particular Article 33(2) and Article 40 thereof,*

## Recitals

(1) Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals ensure the integrity, authenticity and correctness of the process and results of the validation of qualified electronic signatures and of qualified electronic seals respectively. Those qualified trust services play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalent ones.

(2) The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 33(2) and Article (40) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should only apply where qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures and for qualified electronic seals comply with the technical standards set out in this Regulation. Those standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the qualified trust services, as well as the ability to verify the qualified status and technical validity of qualified electronic signatures and qualified electronic seals.

(3) If a trust service provider adheres to the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation, supervisory bodies should presume compliance with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and duly consider such presumption for granting or confirming the qualified status of the trust service. However, a qualified trust services provider may still rely on other practices to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.

(4) The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).], the Commission should review and update this Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

(5) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

(6) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).] and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.
