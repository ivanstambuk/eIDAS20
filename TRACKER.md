## ✅ Completed: Amending Regulation Date Fix

### Bug Identified & Fixed
**Issue**: The Formex v3 converter was extracting `ARTICLE` elements inside `QUOT.S` blocks **twice**:
1. ✅ Correctly as blockquoted replacement content (with dates like "21 May 2026")
2. ❌ Incorrectly as standalone article headers (losing the dates)

**Root Cause**: `extract_articles()` in `formex_to_md_v3.py` used `.findall('.//ARTICLE')` without filtering out articles nested inside `QUOT.S` blocks.

**Fix Applied**: Added logic to build a set of nested `ARTICLE` elements and skip them during extraction.

### Test Suite Created
New file: `scripts/test_formex_converter.py` with **21 unit tests** covering:
- Basic text extraction
- DATE element handling (including non-breaking spaces `\xa0`)
- Nested element processing (HT, NOTE, QUOT markers)
- Amendment list processing
- **Duplicate article extraction bug** (the new test)
- Real-world XML validation against actual Formex files

**All 21 tests pass ✅**
