# Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1945 of 29 September 2025 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the validation of qualified electronic signatures and of qualified electronic seals and the validation of advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates and of advanced electronic seals based on qualified certificates

## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.], and in particular Article 32(3), Article 32a(3), Article 40 and Article 40a thereof,*

## Recitals

**(1)** Qualified electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals, advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates for electronic signatures and advanced electronic seals based on qualified certificates for electronic seals, provided their validity can be confirmed, ensure to relying parties the integrity and authenticity of the signed or sealed data, and enhance the certainty regarding the identity of the signatory or the seal creator. Those electronic signatures and seals play a crucial role in the digital business environment by promoting the transition from traditional paper-based processes to electronic equivalent ones.

**(2)** The presumption of compliance laid down in Article 32(1), Article 40, Article 32a(3) and Article 40a of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 should apply where the processes for the validation of qualified electronic signatures, of qualified electronic seals, of advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates for electronic signatures and of advanced electronic seals based on qualified certificates for electronic seals comply with the technical standards set out in this Regulation. These standards should reflect established practices and be widely recognised within the relevant sectors. They should be adapted to include additional controls ensuring the ability to verify the technical validity of those signatures and seals, and, where applicable, their qualified status.

**(3)** The Commission regularly assesses new technologies, practices, standards or technical specifications. In accordance with recital 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (OJ L, 2024/1183, 30.4.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj).], the Commission should review and update this Regulation, if necessary, to keep it in line with global developments, new technologies, standards or technical specifications and to follow the best practices on the internal market.

**(4)** Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to all personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

**(5)** The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).] and delivered its opinion on 6 June 2025.

**(6)** The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,

**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**
