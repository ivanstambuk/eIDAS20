# Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/849 of 6 May 2025 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the submission of information to the Commission and to the Cooperation Group for the list of certified European Digital Identity Wallets

## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

*Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,*

*Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj.], and in particular Article 5d(7) thereof,*

## Recitals

**(1)** The European Digital Identity Framework ('framework') set out in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 is a crucial component in the establishment of a secure and interoperable digital identity ecosystem across the Union. With the European Digital Identity Wallets ('wallets') as its cornerstone, the framework, aims to facilitate access to online services across Member States, for citizens, residents, and businesses, while ensuring the protection of personal data and privacy.

**(2)** Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).] and, where relevant, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/oj).] apply to the personal data processing activities under this Regulation.

**(3)** In order for the Commission to establish, publish in the *Official Journal of the European Union* and maintain in machine-readable form a list with information submitted by Member States about certified wallets, the Commission should establish formats and procedures for Member States to submit and update the required information to the Commission and the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 46e(1) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 ('Cooperation Group'). Considering that the submitted information is intended to be used by the Commission, the Cooperation Group and the general public, Member States should submit the information at least in English as this facilitates its wide accessibility, assessment and comprehension and at the same time enhances cooperation.

**(4)** The information about certified wallets that Member States should submit is essential to ensure trust, transparency and harmonisation across the wallet ecosystem, fostering confidence among wallet users, wallet providers and regulatory authorities. Therefore, it should include a description of a wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme under which the wallet solution is provided. Such description should entail details on the authority or authorities responsible for the wallet solution and the electronic identification scheme, the applicable supervisory regime, the liability regime with respect to the party providing the wallet solution, arrangements for suspension or revocation of the electronic identification scheme, the wallet solution provided under it or of any compromised parts of it, and on the certificate and certification assessment report of the provision and operation of wallet solutions and of the electronic identification schemes under which they are provided. The information should be sufficient to enable the Commission to establish, publish in the *Official Journal of the European Union* and maintain in a machine-readable form a list of certified wallets. The secure electronic channel used for submitting information related to certified wallets should avoid duplicate submissions of the same information by Member States.

**(5)** The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1725/oj).] and delivered its opinion on 31 January 2025.

**(6)** The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 48 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,

**HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:**
