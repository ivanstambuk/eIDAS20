DECISION (EU) 2022/2481 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 14 December 2022

establishing the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030

(Text with EEA relevance)

---

## Preamble

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 173(3) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,

After consulting the Committee of the Regions,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

### Recitals

- (1) In its communication of 9 March 2021 entitled '2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade' the Commission laid out its vision for 2030 to empower citizens and businesses through digital transformation. The Union's path to the digital transformation should encompass digital sovereignty in an open manner, respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy, inclusion, accessibility, equality, sustainability, resilience, security, improving quality of life, the availability of services and respect for citizens' rights and aspirations.

- (2) The digital transformation is not possible without strong support for science, research, development and the scientific community. Since the degree of digitalisation of the economy or society is a critical underpinning of economic and societal resilience as well as a factor in their global influence, it is necessary for the Union's international action to structure the broad range of existing cooperation in line with the pillars of the Digital Decade.

- (3) In a statement of 25 March 2021, the European Council considered the Digital Compass Communication to be a step towards charting the Union's digital development for the next decade and confirmed the vision set out therein, including the idea of a policy programme with an efficient governance framework.

- (8) The measures envisaged in the Digital Compass Communication should be implemented, building on existing Union instruments, such as programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, the Technical Support Instrument, and the Digital Europe Programme.

- (10) In order to follow the trajectory of the Union regarding the pace of the digital transformation, digital targets should be established at Union level. Those digital targets should be linked to concrete areas: digital skills, digital infrastructures, the digitalisation of businesses, and the digitalisation of public services.
